DAN GOOCH MAKES A DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Do</span> you reckon it&rsquo;ll
seem the same?&rdquo;&nbsp; Talitha, quite breathless with the
long climb, stood looking down at her brother, who was following
more slowly up the scraggy slope of Red Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But say, are
you going to keep up this gait for long?&nbsp; If you do
you&rsquo;ll be plumb tuckered before we get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed, and then sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
anxious to get there, Mart; seems like I can&rsquo;t wait.&nbsp;
To think we&rsquo;ve been away &rsquo;most a year!&nbsp; Do you
s&rsquo;pose Rufe and little Dock&rsquo;ll know us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not they won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sort
o&rsquo; in hopes they&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;ve changed
some,&rdquo; returned Martin.&nbsp; He dropped upon a convenient
ledge and pulled his sister down beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they won&rsquo;t see much difference
in me, but you&rsquo;ve changed a whole lot,&rdquo; Talitha
declared proudly with a sidewise glance of the brown eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;ll notice it the first thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you haven&rsquo;t looked in the glass <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>lately,&rdquo; scoffed Martin, reddening at the implied
praise.&nbsp; &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t the same girl who left for
school last fall with a pigtail hanging down her back and her
dress &rsquo;most to her knees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I looked just as Lalla Ponder did when
she started in this spring, and she&rsquo;s changed a
sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Talitha put up her hands to smooth the soft
roll of wavy hair which had taken the place of the tight, girlish
braid.&nbsp; A year had never made so much difference before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back in the fall,&rdquo; suddenly
announced Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you,
Tally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I know, I am, but it all depends on
mammy.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be harder for me to leave than you, I
reckon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Talitha rose to her feet and adjusted her
bundle knapsack-fashion across her shoulders.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it before dark, I should say,&rdquo;
thinking of the rough mountain way yet to be traversed.&nbsp;
They had left the train early that morning, and walked steadily
since sunrise.&nbsp; Now it lacked a half-hour of noon.</p>
<p>Another steady climb and a descent, and the two found
themselves on familiar ground.&nbsp; At their feet Goose Creek
crept sluggishly.&nbsp; A footpath followed on the low, sloping
bank like a persistent shadow until both were lost to sight in
the curves of the foothills.&nbsp; Here in the cool shade of a
tangled growth, close to the stream, brother and sister paused to
eat <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>their
lunch, which Martin produced from his bundle.&nbsp; They would be
at home in time for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Si Quinn is going to teach the Goose Creek
school this term?&rdquo;&nbsp; Martin helped himself to a
sandwich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so, but I wish he could go to Bentville long
enough to get it out of his head that the earth is square.&nbsp;
To think of his teaching us such foolishness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be of
any use; he&rsquo;s the greatest person to argufy.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s got it all figured out that if the earth is round
we&rsquo;d all be rolled off into nothing.&nbsp; It would be
&lsquo;onpossible&rsquo; to stay on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha dipped her hands in the creek and wiped them on her
handkerchief.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish&mdash;&rdquo; she began, then
stopped suddenly.&nbsp; Martin looked up and his eyes followed
hers.</p>
<p>Around the farther curve of the creek path appeared a
horse&rsquo;s head; then the animal and its rider came slowly
into view.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s somebody from Stone Jug, I
reckon,&rdquo; said Martin, &ldquo;only it rides like Dan
Gooch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Dan Gooch,&rdquo; decided Talitha under her
breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait and see if he knows us,
Mart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old sorrel plodded dejectedly along the path.&nbsp; The
man on his back was as loose-jointed and angular as his
steed.&nbsp; An ancient broad-brimmed hat slouched over his face
to keep out the bright sunlight.&nbsp; If the two seated at the
creek&rsquo;s edge imagined he was about <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>to pass them
unnoticed, they were immediately undeceived, for the man raised
his head and eyed them as though he had come for that express
purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy!&rdquo; said Martin with the tone of one stranger
saluting another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy!&rdquo; responded the man, still staring.&nbsp;
His horse had already stopped and was nosing the herbage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hit ain&rsquo;t Mart Coyle and Tally?&rdquo; exclaimed Dan
Gooch after a speculative silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Talitha sprang up with a
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t know us right off,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;lowed &rsquo;twas you and agin I &rsquo;lowed
&rsquo;twas furriners.&nbsp; I never seen young-uns change so in
sech a few months.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better let me go ahead and
tell your mammy thar&rsquo;s comp&rsquo;ny comin&rsquo; fer
supper.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man slipped from his horse with a
chuckle.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve walked from the Gap,
hit&rsquo;s been a purty stiff climb.&nbsp; Crawl up on the
beastie, Tally, I&rsquo;ll keep Mart comp&rsquo;ny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After much demurring the girl mounted the sorrel and soon both
were lost to sight around the bend.</p>
<p>The sun, a huge, fiery ball, was poised on the bare summit of
a peak in the west, when Talitha reached the edge of a cove on
the mountain-side.&nbsp; Curling indolently upward, the smoke
from a cabin chimney was lost among the trees crowding the slope
beyond.&nbsp; In spite of her haste, she halted the not unwilling
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>sorrel and
sat for a few moments gazing at the place she called home.&nbsp;
The picture in her memory supplied all invisible details.</p>
<p>The cabin was small, one-roomed, with a loft above, the rough,
unbarked logs brown as a beech nut.&nbsp; The mud and stick
chimney at one end looked ready to collapse at the first brisk
wind.&nbsp; There was no glass in the two shuttered openings
which served as windows.&nbsp; The interior of the cabin was
scarcely more attractive.&nbsp; Wide cracks showed in the
puncheon floor, the walls were smoke-stained.&nbsp; In a corner
near the fireplace,&mdash;there was no stove,&mdash;were several
rude shelves filled with coarse, nicked dishes.&nbsp; The loom,
warping bars, spinning wheel, a deal table, with three or four
chairs and a couple of benches, nearly filled the room.&nbsp; A
row of last year&rsquo;s pepper pods and a bunch of herbs still
hung from the dingy ceiling.</p>
<p>Outside, two children romped among the geese and
chickens.&nbsp; Presently a woman, spare and stooping, appeared,
and toiled springward for a bucket of water.&nbsp; Tears filled
Talitha&rsquo;s eyes as she went on.&nbsp; Her mother was not
old, yet she was as careworn and bent as women twice her age in
the village.&nbsp; To the girl, Bentville stood for the world
which lay beyond her mountains, and the longing to transform her
home life into something like the comfort and harmony of those
she had just left was almost overwhelming.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Talitha
rode up to the door amid the joyful shrieks of the children and
the squawks of the fowls as they flew precipitately in every
direction.&nbsp; Dismounting, she released herself as soon as
possible from small embracing arms and hurried to her mother who
had set down the bucket and was eyeing her daughter
perplexedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit &rsquo;pears ter me you&rsquo;ve growed a heap
sence you war gone,&rdquo; was all the comment Mrs. Coyle made
upon Talitha&rsquo;s changed appearance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s Mart?&rdquo; with sudden misgiving as the
girl picked up the bucket of water and stepped briskly along at
her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming.&nbsp; Dan Gooch gave me a lift on
his sorrel and he footed it with Mart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha went on into the cabin, but her mother lingered
outside.&nbsp; She had caught sight of a young, stalwart figure
beside their neighbour.&nbsp; She smoothed her old homespun gown
with worn, calloused hands, and wished she had the
&ldquo;tuckin&rsquo; comb&rdquo; Talitha had sent her for
Christmas in her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, mammy!&rdquo; Martin put his arms around his
mother and kissed her awkwardly.</p>
<p>After Dan Gooch had accepted the hospitable invitation to stay
for supper, the three repaired indoors.&nbsp; Talitha had rallied
the younger members of the family to her assistance, and was
already dishing up the evening meal.&nbsp; A fresh cloth had been
laid, and a handful of mountain laurel, in a tin can on the <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>window-sill,
transferred to the centre of the table.&nbsp; At this juncture
Sam Coyle appeared from the &ldquo;fodder patch.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After a hasty greeting he retreated to the basin of water outside
with a bewildered, company feeling he had not experienced since a
college settlement worker had visited them the year before.</p>
<p>At the table he listened with silent pride to the answers
which Dan Gooch&rsquo;s volley of questions elicited.&nbsp; He
learned that a mountain farm could bring its owner a good living
if rightly cultivated, that Talitha had made with her own hands
the dress and apron of &ldquo;store goods&rdquo; she was
wearing.&nbsp; Perhaps his wife had been in the right after all
when she insisted on the two older children going to school,
although it was against his judgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you-uns hev been a-larnin&rsquo;
carpenterin&rsquo;?&rdquo; continued their neighbour, addressing
Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been working at it all the year, out of
school hours,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then thar&rsquo;s a job waitin&rsquo; fer you at
Squar&rsquo; Dodd&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His house ain&rsquo;t big
&rsquo;nough ter suit him, and he&rsquo;s bound ter hev a
po&rsquo;ch and a lean-to on thet place of
his&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you ever so much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see Mr. Dodd
about it to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Martin&rsquo;s eyes kindled at
the thought of putting his knowledge to such immediate use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon thet school&rsquo;d be a fine place fer my
Abner and Gincy,&rdquo; mused Dan.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;Oh, it would,&rdquo; urged Talitha
delightedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Gincy could room with me if I go
back next year,&rdquo; with an appealing glance at her
father.</p>
<p>Sam Coyle frowned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon a year&rsquo;s
schoolin&rsquo;s &rsquo;nough fer any gal.&nbsp; Hit&rsquo;s a
sight more&rsquo;n I ever had,&rdquo; he said surlily.</p>
<p>His neighbour gave a derisive laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
neither of us read or write no more&rsquo;n if we war blind as
bats.&nbsp; I hain&rsquo;t any mind ter stand in the way of my
chil&rsquo;ren gettin&rsquo; larnin&rsquo;, &rsquo;specially if
hit ain&rsquo;t costin&rsquo; me nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thrust went home, as the speaker intended, for it was well
known that Martin and Talitha had paid for their year at school
by their own exertions.&nbsp; Also that Sam Coyle had taken
little of the added burdens&mdash;during their absence&mdash;upon
his own shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gincy would like it ever so much,&rdquo; pursued
Talitha, anxious to preserve peace.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;d
especially like the singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would, I reckon,&rdquo; agreed her father
proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gincy has a purty ear for a tune, and
I&rsquo;m aimin&rsquo; ter give her a chanct if I didn&rsquo;t
hev one myself,&rdquo; he said, rising to take his departure.</p>
<p>Martin watched him disappear down the slope in silent
astonishment.&nbsp; He had supposed Dan Gooch would be the last
one to see the &ldquo;needcessity of larnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and
here he was the champion of their cause against their own
father.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Talitha
was briskly clearing away the supper dishes when a couple mounted
on one horse rode up to the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Howdy!&rdquo;
greeted Sam Coyle, lounging forward with a show of
cordiality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shad &rsquo;lowed he seen a gal and boy tromp-in&rsquo;
&rsquo;cross the mounting this mornin&rsquo;, and I sez hit
wan&rsquo;t nobody but Mart and Tally,&rdquo; said the old woman,
slipping cautiously to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You war a true prophet fer once, Ann, but I&rsquo;d be
bound nobody&rsquo;d known &rsquo;em anywhere else,&rdquo;
declared her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plumb spiled, most likely,&rdquo; grumbled Ann.&nbsp;
From the depths of her black, slatted sunbonnet the gimlet eyes
keenly scrutinized her nephew and niece.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you
air growed up fer sure, and I reckon you know more&rsquo;n the
old schoolmaster hisself.&nbsp; Thar ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;
like the insurance o&rsquo; young-uns thet&rsquo;s got a leetle
larnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; pursued the old woman with acerbity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now what I want ter know is, what kin you do thet the gals
and boys what never seen Bentville, can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ann
Bills had seated herself before the fireplace, removed her
sunbonnet, and was lighting the pipe she had taken from her
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawsy,&rsquo; Ann,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Coyle
indignantly, &ldquo;their pappy and me air terrible pleased with
what they&rsquo;ve larned, and I don&rsquo;t see no call fer you
ter be so powerful ornery.&nbsp; If all your six boys hed been
gals I&rsquo;ll be <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>bound thar couldn&rsquo;t one of &rsquo;em make a gown
like thet Tally&rsquo;s wearin&rsquo;, and she tuk every stitch
herself.&nbsp; As fer Mart, you&rsquo;ll know what he kin do
&rsquo;fore long, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Coyle and her sister-in-law did not agree on the subject
of education.&nbsp; The latter&rsquo;s family of boys had grown
to man&rsquo;s estate and married without having mastered the
second reader.&nbsp; For once Sam Coyle did not come to his
sister&rsquo;s aid.&nbsp; Although he had no intention of
allowing his children to return to school, he was swelling with
pride at their changed appearance and his tongue was ready to
wage a sharp battle in the cause of
&ldquo;larnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Failing to secure an ally, the old dame prudently changed her
tactics.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hit air purty fair work,&rdquo; she
admitted in a conciliatory tone, scrutinizing the hem of
Talitha&rsquo;s gown.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t set much
store by thet kind o&rsquo; goods; hit can&rsquo;t hold a candle
ter homespun when hit comes ter wear.&nbsp; If I war you,
I&rsquo;d put Tally ter the loom; she air old &rsquo;nough ter be
larnin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; of more &rsquo;count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha turned back to her dishes with a sigh.&nbsp; Martin
had escaped Uncle Shad&rsquo;s equally acrimonious tongue and
gone to interview Squire Dodd.&nbsp; He did not return until the
old couple had taken their departure.</p>
<p>Gincy Gooch came over the very next afternoon.&nbsp; The
dinner work was out of the way and Mrs. Coyle was spinning while
Talitha <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>sat on the doorstep at work on the &ldquo;store
goods&rdquo; Martin had brought his mother for a new gown.&nbsp;
Gincy watched the deft fingers wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pappy says you-uns hev larned a heap of things,&rdquo;
she remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve changed a sight;
&rsquo;most &rsquo;pears ter me you ain&rsquo;t Tally Coyle any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I am, and when
you&rsquo;ve been to Bentville a while you&rsquo;ll change,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kin you reely read books right off &rsquo;thout
spellin&rsquo; out the big words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Talitha nodded, remembering her
shortcomings of only a year ago.&nbsp; If she never went back to
school how many things she had to be thankful for.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like the singing, Gincy,&rdquo; she said
abruptly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so different from any music you ever
heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diff&rsquo;runt, how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll show you.&nbsp; Just begin some song
and don&rsquo;t get off the tune no matter what I
sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t never got off the tune yit,&rdquo;
reproved Gincy.&nbsp; She began in a clear, sweet voice
&ldquo;The Turkish Lady,&rdquo; an old English ballad (one of
many preserved for generations among the mountaineers).&nbsp; It
ran thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lord Bateman was in England born,<br />
He thought himself of a high degree;<br />
He could not rest or be contented<br />
Until he had voyaged across the sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Talitha
joined Gincy in a mellow alto, and together the two sang verse
after verse.&nbsp; The spinning wheel ceased to turn while the
spinner listened to this new blending of voices, for the mountain
people only sang the air.&nbsp; At the edge of the slope Sam
Coyle heard it in amazement.&nbsp; The old ballad was familiar
enough, but it had never sounded so beautiful.</p>
<p>Gincy showed no surprise at the innovation.&nbsp; Her hands
clasped in her lap she looked with large, dreamy eyes off to the
green-topped hills lying peacefully against the shining
sky.&nbsp; The echoes crept out of the silences and chanted the
words softly over and over again.</p>
<p>When the song was finished, Gincy hardly paused to take breath
before she swung into another familiar melody and Talitha
followed, her work forgotten.&nbsp; They had hardly reached the
third line when a bass voice joined them, and Martin dropped down
on the doorstep beside the two girls.</p>
<p>Below, on the creek path, a sorrel horse and its rider had
halted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thet air Gincy&rsquo;s voice fer
sartin.&nbsp; I reckon the Coyles air a-singin&rsquo;, too, but
hit sounds diff&rsquo;runt&rsquo;n I ever hearn &rsquo;em afore;
somethin&rsquo; like them a-choirin&rsquo; up yander, I
reckon,&rdquo; glancing upward.&nbsp; With a regretful sigh he
heard the last echo die away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gincy&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ter hev a chanct ter git
larnin&rsquo;, thet&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; declared Dan Gooch as he
jogged slowly homeward.</p>

MARTIN SURPRISES GOOSE CREEK</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, Martin began work on
the addition to Squire Dodd&rsquo;s cabin.&nbsp; Sam Coyle, much
elated at his son&rsquo;s success in securing the job, hastened
thither and planted himself in the shade to watch its
progress.&nbsp; He was not without company.&nbsp; There were a
number who considered the squire had shown undue haste in giving
so important a piece of work to a &ldquo;striplin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
and had gathered to note proceedings and proffer advice.</p>
<p>Martin listened in silent good humour to the wagging
tongues.&nbsp; That his employer had confidence in his ability
was enough, and he worked with unceasing energy.&nbsp; At the end
of the second day the critics were silenced, and before the week
was over it had been noised abroad that Sam Coyle&rsquo;s son had
come back from school with a trade at his &ldquo;finger eends
&rsquo;sides a heap o&rsquo; book larnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Settlement store was, for the first time in many months, nearly
destitute of loungers.</p>
<p>Instead of the intended lean-to, a one story frame addition
was built across the front of <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>the Dodd cabin, shutting the original
completely from view of the traveller on the creek path.&nbsp; A
wide porch increased the magnificence of the structure, and when
a coat of yellow paint with trimmings of a brilliant red denoted
the completion of Martin&rsquo;s contract, the spectators were
unanimous in agreeing that the mountains had never seen anything
quite so grand.&nbsp; The peaks looked down at the innovation
with a new dignity&mdash;so it seemed to the young
carpenter.&nbsp; He had been learning the value of simplicity,
and he realized how little his handiwork harmonized with the
beauty around it.&nbsp; But he had only carried out the wishes of
the squire, and he dismissed the subject from his mind for
something more weighty was upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking ever since I came home,&rdquo;
he said that night to Talitha, &ldquo;of something Professor
Scott said: &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t enough to get good things for
ourselves, we must pass them on.&rsquo;&nbsp; I wish I could take
some of the boys back to school with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you can reckon on Abner Gooch and the three
Shackley boys already.&nbsp; I call that a pretty fair
beginning.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;ll be more.&nbsp; I heard that
Dan Gooch said yesterday over at the Settlement, &lsquo;If you
want ter know what thet school down below here kin teach your
young-uns, jest look at Squar&rsquo; Dodd&rsquo;s manshun
yander.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin laughed grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If they do go <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>they
won&rsquo;t think it such a work of art when they come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they get back they&rsquo;ll have learned enough to
understand, I reckon,&rdquo; responded Talitha.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
thing is to get them there.&nbsp; You ought to see how
Gincy&rsquo;s working, and the whole family too, for that
matter.&nbsp; I actually believe they&rsquo;ve picked most of the
berries for ten miles around here.&nbsp; They are at it
now.&nbsp; Just think of Dan Gooch going berrying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has some backbone after all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s such a
pity he couldn&rsquo;t have had a chance when he was young.&nbsp;
And that reminds me, I met Gincy &rsquo;way over in Bear Hollow
yesterday morning at sun-up with a bucket.&nbsp; After berries, I
suppose; but I don&rsquo;t see how they&rsquo;re going to eat
&rsquo;em all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat &rsquo;em!&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re
drying &rsquo;em to sell.&nbsp; The Settlement store has promised
to take every pound.&nbsp; Then Mrs. Gooch is reckoning on her
geese feathers, too.&nbsp; If Gincy can only get money enough for
a start, she&rsquo;ll find work to help her through the
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so,&rdquo; assented Martin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re mighty friendly folks at the
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve saved enough now, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Talitha&rsquo;s mind suddenly reverted to her
brother&rsquo;s prospects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll make it do with the odd jobs I can pick
up; but I misdoubt father&rsquo;s being willing for me to go
back.&nbsp; He thinks I know <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>a sight now.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s running
all over the country trying to get me another job, and
here&rsquo;s the crop going to waste.&nbsp; I reckon I&rsquo;m
needed at home for a spell, anyway,&rdquo; and Martin went
gloomily out to work in the much neglected field.</p>
<p>He had seen thrifty orchards and gardens in the little
sheltered coves of those great hills near Bentville, and he had
often pictured his own home with such a background.&nbsp;
Disheartened, the young fellow regarded the task before him for a
moment, then rallied his two younger brothers.&nbsp; With the
promise of a reward they attacked the weeds among the corn while
Martin went on to the little orchard.&nbsp; It was thick with
dead wood, and he fell to pruning the branches
energetically.&nbsp; With the knowledge he had gained what a
change he could make in the place even in the two months left of
his vacation.</p>
<p>Over in the garden he could hear Talitha and her mother.&nbsp;
Tending garden and milking the cow was as much woman&rsquo;s
work, according to the Kentucky mountain code, as washing dishes
or making bread.&nbsp; The sound of a sturdily wielded hoe in the
earth spurred him on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back some time,
anyhow, if I live,&rdquo; he declared, striking deep, vigorous
blows into a lifeless tree trunk.</p>
<p>Had Martin and Talitha only known, their energy spoke volumes
for the Cause lying so near their hearts.&nbsp; A new interest
had been <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>suddenly awakened in the Coyle family.&nbsp; The
slightest pretext took their less ambitious neighbours along the
creek path curious to see &ldquo;what Mart Coyle was up ter
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; A wide, roomy porch across the front of the
cabin&mdash;which Martin had skilfully contrived at little
expense&mdash;served as sitting-room during the warm
weather.&nbsp; Here Talitha&rsquo;s wheel whirred diligently in
the shadow of the vines which had taken kindly to her late
transplanting.</p>
<p>The Coyle enterprise was contagious.&nbsp; Dan Gooch, with a
new-born enthusiasm, valiantly led his sons forth to produce
order from the confusion around the exterior of the cabin.&nbsp;
Inside, Gincy and her mother worked with tireless energy and
bright dreams of the future.</p>
<p>From the first Sunday of Martin&rsquo;s and Talitha&rsquo;s
return, the Gooch family had taken to &ldquo;jest droppin&rsquo;
in,&rdquo; during the afternoon, until it had become a settled
custom followed by one neighbour after another.&nbsp; Part
singing was a novelty of which they never tired.&nbsp; When the
blacksmith&rsquo;s eldest son found that he was the possessor of
a richer, deeper bass voice than Martin&rsquo;s, his delight was
unbounded.&nbsp; There were others besides Gincy who could
successfully hold their own in the air in spite of the other
parts, although Gincy&rsquo;s clear, bird-like tones rang above
theirs on the high notes.</p>
<p>And so the summer wore away, and the heralds of approaching
autumn sounded a <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>warning note in the breezes and fluttered their signals
from the mountain slopes.</p>
<p>It was only a week before the time for their departure that
Sam Coyle gave a reluctant consent to Martin&rsquo;s and
Talitha&rsquo;s return to school.&nbsp; Two others besides Abner
and Gincy were to accompany them&mdash;Peter and Isaac Shackley,
sons of the blacksmith at the Settlement.&nbsp; Peter was to take
his horse, a handsome bay of which he was very proud, the fifty
miles to Bentville, and then sell it to defray his expenses at
the school.&nbsp; It had taken him a long time to determine on
the sacrifice, and his was the only sober face in the merry
little company which set forth that September morning.</p>
<p>The night before, the other members of the party came to the
Coyle cabin in order to make an early start.&nbsp; That six young
people were to leave for Bentville the next morning made a stir
at Goose Creek.&nbsp; They were favourites in the mountains, and
during the evening a dozen families called with some parting gift
or admonition.&nbsp; They were not all wisely chosen, but the
kindest intentions prompted each offering.&nbsp; From the younger
ones there were various gifts of fruit and flowers.&nbsp; Ann
Bills had so far relented as to present her niece with two pairs
of wool stockings which Talitha could not refuse however much she
would have liked to do so.&nbsp; Mrs. Twilliger brought several
strings of <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>freshly dried pumpkin which she much feared Gincy might
&ldquo;git ter hankerin&rsquo; arter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Slawson
boy, who was &ldquo;light-minded,&rdquo; brought his pet coon and
wept bitterly when Abner gently but firmly refused it.&nbsp;
Little Tad Suttle was equally persistent in forcing on them his
dog Wulf, who was warranted to keep the bears and painters at a
proper distance when the company crossed the mountains.</p>
<p>The Bills family were inclined to consider the occasion a
mournful one.&nbsp; If the young people had been going to the
ends of the earth instead of but fifty miles away, they could not
have been more pessimistic.&nbsp; That Martin and Talitha had
returned unharmed seemed to have no weight with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho, now,&rdquo; objected the blacksmith jovially,
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter cornsider my young-uns as
lost ter the mountings.&nbsp; I &rsquo;low they&rsquo;re jest
goin&rsquo; ter git some larnin&rsquo; and come back ter help
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Book larnin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter give
&rsquo;em muscle,&rdquo; objected the elder Bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law, no, they&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;nough of thet
now.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t raisin&rsquo; a passel of
prizefighters.&nbsp; If Kid stays home ter help me one
blacksmith&rsquo;s &rsquo;nough in a family, I reckon.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve heerd the Bentville school is great on idees, and
thet&rsquo;s jest what these mountings air needin&rsquo;
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like we war plumb idjits, Enoch
Shackley,&rdquo; cried Ann Bills, her black eyes <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>snapping
angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heerd tell o&rsquo; folks
you&rsquo;d never &rsquo;low had any head stuff&rsquo;in&rsquo;
till their skulls got a crack and you could git a sight of their
brains, but I never heerd as this part of the kentry war noted
fer sech.&nbsp; Me and my fambly hain&rsquo;t never had ter go
borrowin&rsquo; fer idees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lands, no,&rdquo; said Mrs. Twilliger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hold up your head with the best of &rsquo;em, Gincy; Goose
Creek folks hain&rsquo;t never took a back seat fer
nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the callers melted away and the weary people they left
behind hurried to bed to get what sleep they might before time
for their early departure.</p>
<p>As the little party started down the slope the next morning, a
wonderful light quavered above the mountain-tops for the most
part covered with a thick, gorgeous leafage of crimson, green,
and gold flaming out among the duller browns.&nbsp; Now and then
a rough, scraggy peak like Bear Knob showed grimly against the
sky.&nbsp; Below them the mists lay huddled asleep awaiting the
coming of the sun.&nbsp; The cool smell of the night was still in
the air.&nbsp; Down where the creek path trailed out of sight
came a jubilant chorus of bird voices.</p>
<p>A strange feeling made Gincy&rsquo;s heart beat faster, and a
lump rose in her throat.&nbsp; But what might have happened did
not, for Talitha, with foresight, reached up and laid a rough, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>brown hand
tenderly over the one on the pommel of the saddle.&nbsp; Gincy
looked down into the blue eyes smiling encouragement and was
herself again.</p>
<p>A straggling little procession, they followed the slim stream
which curved around the base of the hills.&nbsp; At noon the
party stopped to eat their lunch on its banks, and then they left
it for a steep climb up the mountain.</p>
<p>An hour before sunset they had made good progress, coming out
suddenly upon a cleared cove halfway down the mountain.&nbsp; At
the farther side, against a background of pines, stood a large,
well-built cabin.&nbsp; Vines tinted with autumn colouring
clambered over the broad porch.&nbsp; The space in front was
cleanly swept.&nbsp; Back of the low palings in the rear was a
large, thrifty garden, and fragrant odours of ripening fruit came
from the small, but heavily-laden, orchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell that a Bentville student lives here, all
right,&rdquo; said Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is where Tally and I
stayed over night on our way to school last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their approach had been discovered, for two hounds ran around
the house barking a joyful greeting.&nbsp; Then a tall, muscular
young fellow hurried out of the door, followed by other members
of the family.</p>
<p>There was no look of dismay on Joe Bradshaw&rsquo;s face at
the size of the party.&nbsp; With <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>true mountain hospitality they were
given a hearty welcome.</p>
<p>Inside the house Gincy looked around curiously.&nbsp; The two
rooms were better furnished and neater than even Squire
Dodd&rsquo;s, which represented to her the height of
elegance.&nbsp; In the living-room the supper was cooking over a
stove; the fireplace was not even lighted.&nbsp; A white linen
cloth of Mrs. Bradshaw&rsquo;s own weaving covered the table, and
there seemed to be plenty of dishes without the makeshifts common
in her home and those of other mountain families she knew.&nbsp;
True, it was only coarse, blue earthenware, but in her
unaccustomed eyes nothing could be finer.</p>
<p>In the next room were two beds covered with blue and white
&ldquo;kivers,&rdquo; also the product of the loom which stood in
the corner of the living-room.&nbsp; Pinned on the walls were a
half-dozen prints and bright-coloured pictures.&nbsp; Cheesecloth
curtains were looped back from the windows, and on the mission
table, of Joe&rsquo;s making, was a store lamp with a flowered
shade, and more books than Gincy had seen in all her life
before.</p>
<p>That night she could hardly sleep for thinking of the wonders
awaiting her on the morrow in the promised land of which she had
dreamed through all the toil of the long summer days.</p>
<h2><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>III<br

TALITHA SOLVES A PUZZLING PROBLEM</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Joe Bradshaw</span> was a member of the
little party which set forth early the next morning with renewed
expectations.&nbsp; Not a cloud hovered in the deep blue of the
sky as they followed the devious trails across the mountains and
along the foothills, valleyward.&nbsp; At the end of ten miles
they reached the railroad.&nbsp; It was the first all but three
of the party had ever seen.&nbsp; The horse the two girls were
riding shied in terror at sight of the monster puffing forth
clouds of smoke and steam.&nbsp; The passengers in the coaches
looked curiously out at the bright, young faces shadowed by white
sunbonnets.&nbsp; Gincy clung to Talitha and drew a long breath
of relief as bell and whistle sounded and the train swept on, its
rumble and roar re-echoing among the hills.</p>
<p>After that, the rest of the way seemed short indeed, so near
were the travellers to their journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Every few
miles now were homes which bore evidences of a thrift and energy
which had not yet penetrated far into <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>the mountains.&nbsp; One by one the
stars came out, and a full moon climbed over the ridge and made a
silvery, elusive pathway across the foothills.&nbsp; Another turn
in the trail, and presently the foot-sore pilgrims came to a
smooth pike.&nbsp; A half-hour later they looked upon shadowy
roofs among tall trees where lights twinkled faintly in the
radiance of the moon.</p>
<p>Martin and Joe hurried ahead along the street sure of a
welcome, and they were not disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are our two standbys again, and they didn&rsquo;t
come alone, either,&rdquo; greeted the secretary with a hearty
shake of the hand as the boys entered the office.</p>
<p>The girls were taken in charge by the dean, who whisked them
off to the dining-room for a late supper.&nbsp; After that, with
much contriving, they were stowed comfortably away for the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go straight to sleep,&rdquo;
admonished Talitha.&nbsp; &ldquo;Half-past five will come before
you know it and then the rising bell rings.&nbsp; I expect
we&rsquo;ll feel pretty stiff for a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy only murmured a drowsy reply.&nbsp; She was already
dreaming a beautiful dream, quite unaware of what Mrs. Donnelly,
the dean, was saying to Miss Howard, her assistant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we can keep the girl who came
with Talitha Coyle.&nbsp; We are overflowing <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>already.&nbsp; Two beds in every room
upstairs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we manage some way?&rdquo; urged Miss
Howard for the tenth time that day.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a
bright little thing.&nbsp; If she were only a boy now, and yet
the boys are coming in at a great rate this year; it&rsquo;s
wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dean&rsquo;s smooth
forehead wrinkled in perplexity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; with a
sudden inspiration, &ldquo;if that girl from Kerby Knob
doesn&rsquo;t put in an appearance&mdash;she wrote me that her
mother was sick and she was afraid she
couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;ll keep Gincy, but if Urilla does
come back we shall be obliged to give her precedence because she
will be a junior this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the matter rested, and blissfully ignorant of the fact that
her good fortune was another girl&rsquo;s misfortune, Gincy arose
in the morning supremely happy.&nbsp; She was not to remain long
a stranger, for Talitha was a person who made friends&mdash;hosts
of them&mdash;she had such a way of forgetting Talitha Coyle, and
in a few hours they were Gincy&rsquo;s also.&nbsp; She laughed
and chatted among the girls as she helped wipe the great stacks
of dishes after the early breakfast.&nbsp; There were no lessons
yet, but when the morning&rsquo;s work was done and the services
at the chapel over, Kizzie Tipton proposed a walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the dean said you needn&rsquo;t hurry to get
registered,&rdquo; added her new friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>meet you
on the front porch in five minutes,&rdquo; and Kizzie ran to her
room.</p>
<p>Gincy opened the hall door also in haste.&nbsp; She had
thought of something she wished to say to Talitha&mdash;who was
just going down the steps with her books&mdash;and nearly ran
against a tall, pale-faced girl carrying a heavy handbag.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Gincy ejaculated with a swift glance at the wan
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jest let me ketch a holt.&nbsp; I &rsquo;most
tuk you down, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weary eyes brightened.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a new
girl,&rdquo; asserted the late arrival confidently as Gincy
deposited the baggage in a corner of the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she nodded, &ldquo;I reckon I be, but I
don&rsquo;t seem ter sense hit much.&nbsp; Hit&rsquo;s the nicest
place I ever see fer findin&rsquo; friends,&rdquo; and Gincy
disappeared with a parting smile.</p>
<p>The newcomer sat down in thoughtful silence, forgetting that
she had not made known her arrival to the dean.&nbsp; But that
lady chanced to espy her from the top of the stairs and slowly
descended, inwardly determined that her face should not reveal
her embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Urilla, you succeeded in getting here after
all,&rdquo; she said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered the girl, rising
respectfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s able to sit up most of
the time, and she wouldn&rsquo;t hear to my staying home now
Sally&rsquo;s big enough to help.&nbsp; If I <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>can only
manage to stay another year.&rdquo;&nbsp; Urilla gave a long
sigh.</p>
<p>The girl was sent to her room to get a little rest before
dinner, and Gincy, returning from her walk in a high state of
exuberance, was called to the office.</p>
<p>Two hours later, Talitha came unexpectedly upon Mrs.
Donnelly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been looking for you,&rdquo; said
that lady soberly.&mdash;It was a very difficult thing she had to
do.&mdash;&ldquo;I am very sorry to be the bearer of such bad
news, but we shall be obliged to send Gincy
home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send her home!&rdquo; echoed Talitha in amazement,
turning pale and trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Urilla Minter has come back, and there isn&rsquo;t
room for both of them; we&rsquo;re crowded beyond the limit
now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done my best, but not a place can be found
for her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll keep her name on the books so she will
have an opportunity to come back next year.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs.
Donnelly&rsquo;s heart was sore at parting with one of her flock
who was so eager for an education.&nbsp; There were tears in her
eyes as she turned away.</p>
<p>Talitha wandered out to a seat on the campus to think over the
dreadful tidings.&nbsp; Gincy going home after working so hard
all the summer to come!&nbsp; This would be her last chance, for
Dan Gooch would never get over her being sent back, and he would
hate the Coyles because Gincy would not have thought of attending
the school had it not been for <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Talitha.&nbsp; All the beautiful,
rosy clouds which had glorified the morning sky faded, leaving it
dull and grey.</p>
<p>Gincy must not go home; that Talitha instantly decided,
but&mdash;The girl sat for a long time struggling with herself,
her hands clasped over the precious little pile of books in her
lap.&nbsp; She was in a far corner, unnoticed by the merry bands
of students passing back and forth.&nbsp; She could hear their
laughter and happy chatter.&nbsp; Oh, it was hard, so hard!</p>
<p>At last, Talitha rose quickly as though she were afraid her
courage might vanish, and hastened to the hall and straight to
Mrs. Donnelly&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to tell
you,&rdquo; she began breathlessly, with a little tremor in her
voice, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve decided to go
home.&nbsp; Gincy can stay, then.&nbsp; She mustn&rsquo;t go,
Mrs. Donnelly, she&rsquo;s been workin&rsquo; and lottin&rsquo;
on it all summer and her folks wouldn&rsquo;t ever let her come
back again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go and you&rsquo;ll give her my
place, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean never forgot the pleading face lifted to hers.&nbsp;
It was white and the lips were trembling, but the light of a
heroic, self-sacrificing spirit shone in the dark eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, my child,&rdquo; protested the woman, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t bear to think of your going home.&nbsp; If I could
only plan some way, but I&rsquo;ve tried and tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; nodded Talitha, &ldquo;but I never
once thought there wouldn&rsquo;t be room for everybody who
wanted to come.&nbsp; Anyway, I&rsquo;m glad <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Gincy&rsquo;s
going to have a chance.&nbsp; You ought to hear her sing, Mrs.
Donnelly.&nbsp; And if you&rsquo;ll sort o&rsquo; mother her a
little I&rsquo;ll be real thankful.&nbsp; Gincy&rsquo;s never
been away from home before, and her folks were going to feel so
easy because I was with her.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t feel bad, it
couldn&rsquo;t be helped, I reckon, and maybe I&rsquo;ll come
back next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha&rsquo;s heart was heavy indeed as she climbed the
stairs to her room.&nbsp; She found Gincy in a corner weeping
piteously over the few belongings gathered in a little
heap.&nbsp; Talitha knelt beside her and put an arm tenderly
around the thin, bowed shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your things right back, Gincy,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re going to stay after all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
just seen Mrs. Donnelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy looked up in astonishment that at first was too great
for words.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean hit?&rdquo; she
gasped at last, clutching her friend&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I do,&rdquo; Talitha nodded with a smile.&nbsp;
Her own burden lightened wonderfully at the sight of
Gincy&rsquo;s radiant face and suddenly dried tears.&nbsp; She
left the girl putting her belongings back in drawers and closet
with a joyful haste.&nbsp; Gincy had not even inquired how this
transformation had been wrought; it was enough for her to know
that she was not to be sent home.</p>
<p>Talitha&rsquo;s next duty was to find Martin and make known
her resolution.&nbsp; After a long <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>search he was discovered in the
library with a pile of reference books before him.&nbsp; He
looked up with shining eyes.&nbsp; She knew how he rejoiced in
the opportunity for another year&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; It would
take away half his pleasure to learn that she would not be there
to share it, still she was confident that he would see the wisdom
of her resolve.&nbsp; At a sign from her he followed wonderingly
out back of the building to a seat under one of the large trees
of the campus where they would be unnoticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Gincy coming on?&nbsp; She isn&rsquo;t
getting homesick a&rsquo;ready, is she?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gincy!&nbsp; Not much; she&rsquo;s pleased as can be
with everything here.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I came to see you
about.&rdquo;&nbsp; Talitha paused and looked down at her folded
hands, while Martin sat staring at her in bewilderment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mrs. Donnelly came to see me this morning,&rdquo; she went
on presently.&nbsp; &ldquo;She told me that Gincy must go home,
that there is no place for her.&nbsp; So many girls have come
this fall the rooms are crowded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home!&rdquo; repeated Martin indignantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, we can&rsquo;t let her; she mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been crying till
she&rsquo;s &rsquo;most beat out, but I&rsquo;ve been thinking it
over and Gincy&rsquo;s going to stay.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just seen
Mrs. Donnelly again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m mighty glad!&rdquo;&nbsp; Martin gave
<a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>a long
breath of relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did you manage it,
Tally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home instead,&rdquo; she answered
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her brother sprang up
excitedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tally, I won&rsquo;t hear to
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will.&nbsp; Sit down, Mart, you&rsquo;d do the
same thing if you were in my place, you know you would.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not going to be selfish.&nbsp; Gincy&rsquo;s never had
any chance and I&rsquo;ve had a whole year here.&nbsp; Maybe I
can come back again some time, but if I knew I couldn&rsquo;t I
should go just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t go home alone,&rdquo; Martin
objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take the train to the Gap
and I&rsquo;m not afraid to walk the rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tally, I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; her
brother said at last, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;ll take the sunshine
out of the whole year for me, to know that you&rsquo;re missing
all this.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;d counted so on the good times
we&rsquo;d have together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mart, don&rsquo;t you worry about me one
minute.&nbsp; I reckon it&rsquo;s all for the best.&nbsp; Maybe
there&rsquo;s something special in the mountains for me to do;
I&rsquo;m going to try to think so anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What reason are you going to give the folks for going
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell them the truth that there
wasn&rsquo;t room for so many girls.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>say a word
about Gincy only that she&rsquo;s well and having a fine
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That afternoon while Gincy was out of the room, Talitha
removed the tiny wardrobe she had brought, to make room for
Urilla&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Long before light the next morning, while
Gincy slept soundly, all unaware of her friend&rsquo;s sacrifice,
Talitha boarded the train which could only take her so short a
distance toward home.&nbsp; She sank into a seat timidly.&nbsp;
She had never travelled alone before, and when she reached the
Gap the loneliest part was yet to come.</p>
<p>As the train pulled out she tried to wave a cheerful good-bye
to Martin, who stood disconsolately outside in the
darkness.&nbsp; The coach was full of people who had evidently
travelled all night, for they were in all sorts of positions
trying to get a little sleep.&nbsp; Talitha&rsquo;s eyes were
sleepless, although she had hardly closed them that night.&nbsp;
It was disagreeably warm and stuffy.&nbsp; She longed to open the
window, but the girl beside her was propped comfortably in the
corner of the seat, oblivious to her surroundings.</p>
<p>Talitha looked at her curiously.&nbsp; She was a mountain
girl, that was evident, but not from Goose Creek nor the
Settlement&mdash;possibly from Redbird.&nbsp; She might be kin to
the Twilligers, there were legions of them scattered through the
mountains, and she favoured them wonderfully, now Talitha thought
of it.</p>
<p>Suddenly the girl opened her eyes and stared <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>at
Talitha.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon I must hev been asleep,&rdquo; she
said with a wide yawn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whar did you git
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Bentville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bentville!&nbsp; What kind of a place is hit?&nbsp; I
come purty nigh goin&rsquo; thar onct and then I changed my
mind.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t pin myself down ter book
larnin&rsquo; nohow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha viewed the speaker with astonishment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; she inquired coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piny Twilliger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know that Gincy Gooch is going to school at
Bentville?&rdquo; asked Talitha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law me, why Gincy&rsquo;s my cousin.&nbsp; Whatever put
hit into her head?&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t hev thought hit of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know Gincy,&rdquo; was the
retort.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s as ambitious as can be and loves
to study.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s going to be somebody, I tell
you.&nbsp; Abner&rsquo;s at school too, and their folks are so
proud of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law me,&rdquo; said the girl again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never heerd of any kin ter the Twilligers takin&rsquo; ter
larnin&rsquo; afore,&rdquo; and she relapsed into silent
amazement.&nbsp; She had not recovered speech when the small
station at the Gap was reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ter think I never asked her name!&rdquo; murmured
Gincy&rsquo;s cousin in sudden dismay as Talitha left the
car.</p>

/>
THE STORM</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Talitha alighted from the
train the sun had not yet risen, but the rosy banners which
heralded its coming floated wide across the eastern sky.&nbsp; It
was on a morning like this that she and Martin had started
homeward with such elation of spirits, such hopes for the coming
year.&nbsp; But then summer was just begun; now it had gone and
her hopes with it.</p>
<p>She started across the foothills and up the long mountain
trail, the old elasticity gone from her step, the hardness of her
lot weighting her down.&nbsp; It seemed as though her feet could
never carry her the long, weary way home.&nbsp; Upon a jutting
crag she stopped and looked back.&nbsp; Far in the distance,
cradled among the foothills of the Cumberlands, it lay, the place
of her heart&rsquo;s desire.&nbsp; Would she ever see it
again?</p>
<p>Talitha looked at the sky.&nbsp; The breakfast bell would be
ringing by this time, and happy, laughing faces gathered around
the long tables.&nbsp; Her head bowed as though she could hear
the fervent grace, and a sob rose in her throat.&nbsp; <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Suddenly the
petition of a young leader at prayers, the night before, came to
her: &ldquo;Wilt Thou give us strength and courage to meet
bravely the trials and temptations of each day.&rdquo;&nbsp; How
full of meaning they were to the one who uttered them Talitha
well knew.&nbsp; Owen Calfee&rsquo;s face showed with what high
courage he was meeting the hardships which had beset his path
from early youth.</p>
<p>Talitha fiercely blinked back the tears.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m plumb spoilin&rsquo; everythin&rsquo; by my
foolishness,&rdquo; she thought aloud, unconsciously relapsing
into the speech of the mountains.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon hit
ain&rsquo;t pleasin&rsquo; ter the Lord&mdash;my thinkin&rsquo;
sech sorry thoughts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve clean forgotten that
I&rsquo;d ought ter be thankful that Martin could stay and that
Gincy&rsquo;s havin&rsquo; a chance.&nbsp; My, but if she
isn&rsquo;t the happiest child!&rdquo;&nbsp; Talitha rose
reluctantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to be caught in
the dark, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m bound to be if I stop
here any longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; She stretched out her hands toward
the valley with a wistful gesture of parting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re there, Gincy,&rdquo; she
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have you home for
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the long forenoon&rsquo;s weary climb up the
mountain&rsquo;s interminable slope and over its craggy crest to
the other side, she resolutely laid aside all thoughts of her
disappointment and began making plans to be put into execution as
soon as possible after reaching home.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>At noon
she was almost thankful that she had not reached the creek where
the little party had lunched so happily two days before.&nbsp;
Now she spread her simple fare upon a smooth ledge and watched
the varied light and shadow across the fast changing foliage as
she ate.&nbsp; The birds fluttered and sang in the pines above
her head.&nbsp; Now and then one grew bold enough to fly down for
the crumbs she scattered upon the ground.&nbsp; Over the opposite
edge of the flinty table a pair of bright eyes peered
longingly.&nbsp; Talitha laughed as she flung the bushy-tailed
visitor her last morsel, and rose to resume her journey.</p>
<p>She planned to reach home by supper time, but it had not been
so easy to travel without the aid of a strong arm over the
roughest places.&nbsp; No thought of fear had entered her mind
until that moment; now the prospect of being alone at night on
those wooded heights where the darkness was dense under the thick
branching trees made her shrink.</p>
<p>The afternoon was half gone when Talitha dropped down at the
foot of a pine, tired and footsore.&nbsp; She was not yet rested
from the journey of the two days previous, and it seemed as
though her aching feet could never carry her home that
night.&nbsp; She sat debating with herself as to the possibility
of finding a nearby shelter.&nbsp; Not a cabin was in
sight.&nbsp; She looked around anxiously, shading her eyes with
her hand, to peer along the ridges.&nbsp; A <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>broad shaft
of sunlight lay across the leafage of the opposite
mountain.&nbsp; How vividly it brought out the autumn tints which
flecked the green like rich tapestry.&nbsp; Then, with a
frightened gasp of dismay, she noticed for the first time the
pile of threatening clouds in the west, and the long, deep
shadows which lay in the hollows of those great hills.</p>
<p>Over the highest peak of the ridge beyond, they were
coming&mdash;the slim, mist-coloured lances of the storm.&nbsp;
Down the mountain-side they marched, legion after legion.&nbsp; A
swift line of fire zigzagged above their heads, and suddenly the
sky seemed filled with the rattle of musketry.</p>
<p>Talitha fled, at the first sign of approach, to the shelter of
a thick cluster of oaks.&nbsp; She reached it trembling and
breathless only to see a cabin a few rods beyond.&nbsp; Without
waiting to speculate who its occupants might be, she ran to it,
the storm at her back, the wind contesting each step over the
rough slope.&nbsp; Her little bundle was a cumbrous weight upon
her shoulders.</p>
<p>At the door the girl knocked hurriedly.&nbsp; Her heart was
beating fast.&nbsp; It was twilight around her, and the voice of
the storm came up with a terrible roar.&nbsp; There was no answer
from within the cabin and the door did not open, but in her great
stress Talitha entered timidly.</p>
<p>The wind closed the door violently behind <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>her before
she realized that the place was not empty.&nbsp; The feeble flame
in the fireplace left the one room mostly in shadow, but it
revealed the occupant, a weazened old man, wrapped in a faded
quilt, sitting before the hearth.&nbsp; Talitha felt a sudden
relief that she was not alone while such a storm raged
outside.&nbsp; A man sick and perhaps in need of care was not to
her an object of fear even though a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declar&rsquo; if hit ain&rsquo;t Tally Coyle!&rdquo;
came in wheezy tones from the depths of the bed-quilt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I &rsquo;lowed you war off ter the valley school long
&rsquo;fore this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha could hardly find her voice so great was her
astonishment.&nbsp; She had gone farther out of her way than she
knew to stumble upon her old teacher&rsquo;s cabin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, howdy, Mr. Quinn, you aren&rsquo;t sick, are
you?&rdquo; she said, throwing down her bundle and shaking the
raindrops from her moist skirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest ailin&rsquo; a leetle mite.&nbsp; I hevn&rsquo;t
been what you mought call robustious the hull summer, and last
week I was took with a mis&rsquo;ry in my chist.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
been honin&rsquo; the hull day ter see some one and here
you&rsquo;ve come.&nbsp; I reckon the Lord sent you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The old man broke into a wheezing cough which left him
panting.</p>
<p>Talitha went to the fireplace and piled on fresh wood with a
lavish hand.&nbsp; There was a brisk crackling as the flames shot
upward <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>merrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going right to get
supper,&rdquo; she declared, forgetful of her weariness.</p>
<p>Si Quinn spread his hands before the blaze with a sigh of
content, and watched the girl as she bustled about the
cabin.&nbsp; There was much to do before even a simple meal could
be prepared, for the schoolmaster&rsquo;s housekeeping even in
health was sadly at variance with the methods Talitha had learned
at school the past year.</p>
<p>She brushed the floor as best she could with the stubby old
broom, and then attacked the pile of soiled dishes
energetically.&nbsp; Outside, the storm raged with fury, and a
little rivulet trickled from under the door across the rough
boards of the floor.&nbsp; Later the corn pone was set to baking,
while the girl fried a platter of bacon and a dish of
potatoes.&nbsp; In a corner of the fireplace, on a few coals
among the hot ashes, the coffee pot sent forth an odour
delightful to the nostrils of a half-famished man.&nbsp; Si Quinn
sniffed it eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t set down ter sech a meal o&rsquo;
vittles sence I war ter your house,&rdquo; he remarked gleefully
as he drew his chair to the table and helped himself liberally to
the homely fare.&nbsp; &ldquo;A squar&rsquo; meal will do me a
heap more good&rsquo;n medsun.&nbsp; If I war reel sodden in
selfishness, I&rsquo;d wish you hadn&rsquo;t any kin and could
stay right along here with me.&nbsp; But I ain&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m
thankful you&rsquo;ve got a better place&rsquo;n this ol&rsquo;
shack.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Talitha
looked at him curiously.&nbsp; She had never seen her old
schoolmaster in such a kindly, paternal mood.&nbsp; In her
younger days, the lean, spectacled face had inspired her with awe
and a kind of terror.&nbsp; But since her return from Bentville
she thought of him with pity, not unmingled with contempt, at his
ignorance and dogged belief in the strange theories which still
prevailed in the isolated portions of the mountains.&nbsp; She
looked at the haggard old face that showed unmistakable signs of
past suffering, with a troubled conscience.</p>
<p>At last Si Quinn leaned back with a long sigh of
satisfaction.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ve &rsquo;bout
saved my life, Tally.&nbsp; I war beginnin&rsquo; ter feel hit
warn&rsquo;t much use ter hold on ter this world when thar
warn&rsquo;t nobody seemin&rsquo; ter care speshul.&nbsp; Then
you came along jest as though you&rsquo;d been blowed acrost the
mountings.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m mighty cur&rsquo;us &rsquo;bout hit,
Tally.&nbsp; Only a couple o&rsquo; days ago, Dan Gooch looked in
and said you-uns, and Ab and Gincy, hed started fer school.&nbsp;
Did the folks down thar reckon you&rsquo;d hed &rsquo;nough
larnin&rsquo; and send you back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha hesitated.&nbsp; She wisely felt the need of being
very cautious as to the report which would go abroad.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We did go,&rdquo; she acknowledged, &ldquo;but the
Girls&rsquo; Hall was full&mdash;just running over, the dean
said&mdash;and the folks around had taken all they could.&nbsp;
There wasn&rsquo;t another one could be squeezed in, so I <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>came&mdash;back,&rdquo; she concluded, a renewed sense
of her disappointment nearly overwhelming her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s Gincy?&rdquo; demanded the old man
keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she stayed.&nbsp; She hasn&rsquo;t ever had a
chance, you know.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d have been terribly
disappointed to have had to come home, and so would her father;
he&rsquo;s been lottin&rsquo; on it all summer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
so glad they let her stay,&rdquo; Talitha added, fervently hoping
that her secret had not slipped out unaware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s cur&rsquo;us, mighty cur&rsquo;us,&rdquo;
mused Si Quinn, looking off into the fire as though he had not
heard a word Talitha had been saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;d
been askin&rsquo; and askin&rsquo; the Lord ter send you here,
then Dan Gooch comes &rsquo;long and &rsquo;lows I won&rsquo;t
set eyes on you agin till next summer and here you be.&nbsp;
Ain&rsquo;t hit cur&rsquo;us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard you were sick,&rdquo; faltered the
girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have come before if I&rsquo;d only
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wan&rsquo;t hit,&rdquo; rejoined the
schoolmaster.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve allers done fer myself,
sick or well.&nbsp; I hain&rsquo;t ever been used ter bein&rsquo;
coddled afore, that ain&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s on my mind,
Tally.&nbsp; I wanted ter tell you thet I&rsquo;ve been a sorry
teacher, but I never sensed hit till you-uns came back from
Bentville.&nbsp; I never had no sech chance ter git
larnin&rsquo;, and hit seems a turrible pity you couldn&rsquo;t
hev stayed, but I know &rsquo;thout your <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>tellin&rsquo;
me that you-uns came back ter give Gincy a
chanct&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; implored
Talitha.&nbsp; &ldquo;Father&rsquo;d be so angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit shan&rsquo;t git no further, but hit war jest like
Tally Coyle ter do hit, and mebbe the Lord had a hand in hit,
too.&nbsp; I cal&rsquo;late He knew jest how much the Goose Creek
school needed a teacher, fer I ain&rsquo;t ever goin&rsquo; back
thar agin, Tally.&nbsp; My teachin&rsquo; days air over, but my
heart hones fer those pore lambs that&rsquo;s so set on
gittin&rsquo; larnin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I want you ter take &rsquo;em
and teach &rsquo;em all you kin.&nbsp; Mebbe next year you-uns
kin go back ter Bentville.&nbsp; Hit seems queer they
couldn&rsquo;t hev put up some kind of a shack fer the gals ter
stay in.&nbsp; A lot of strong, young fellers like Mart, now,
could hev taken holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course,&rdquo; agreed Talitha, &ldquo;but
it would take money to make it comfortable, and the Bentville
folks haven&rsquo;t any to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man nodded thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s
mighty strange when I&rsquo;ve heerd thar&rsquo;s folks
livin&rsquo; in cities that&rsquo;s more money&rsquo;n they can
anyways spend.&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s the mounting boys and gals
a-thirstin&rsquo; fer the larnin&rsquo; they can&rsquo;t
git.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl crouched before the fire puzzled over
this new problem, while Si Quinn creaked back and forth in the
old rocker.</p>
<p>Suddenly it stopped.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d git the
Book, Tally, over on the chist, and read a spell; you do hit so
easy-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>Outside, in the wild night, the wind wailed loudly along
the wooded ridges of the great hills and hurled itself in angry
gusts against the little cabin unnoticed, as Talitha read chapter
after chapter in clear, unfaltering tones.&nbsp; The old man
looked fondly down at her with a paternal pride.&nbsp; His heart
was at peace, for he had bequeathed his life work to younger,
more capable hands, and he rested content.</p>
<h2><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>V<br
/>
AN UNEXPECTED RIVAL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> consternation at the Coyle
cabin was great indeed when midway of the next afternoon Talitha
appeared, after making the old schoolmaster as comfortable as
possible.&nbsp; Although Sam Coyle had given but a grudging
assent to his daughter&rsquo;s return to Bentville, he now loudly
bewailed the necessity which prevented her from
&ldquo;gittin&rsquo; more larnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wrath cooled, however, when he learned that Si Quinn, who
was highly esteemed by the dwellers around Red Mountain, had
abdicated his place in the Goose Creek school in Talitha&rsquo;s
favour.&nbsp; It was an unprecedented honour, as
&ldquo;gal&rdquo; teachers were not looked upon favourably among
the mountaineers.&nbsp; It being the prevailing opinion that only
a man could fill the position with the requisite dignity and
severity.</p>
<p>Remembering the tradition, the beginning was an ordeal from
which the girl inwardly shrank.&nbsp; She had never felt so
helplessly ignorant in all her life, although she had so often
smiled with her brother over Si Quinn&rsquo;s incompetency.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>It was
soon rumoured that the old man had sent for Talitha Coyle to come
home and finish the remaining school months.&nbsp; In the
mountains, school begins the first of July and ends the last of
December; when the heavy rains and snows make travel well-nigh
impossible.&nbsp; For a week the little flock of pupils had been
teacher-less, and Talitha was admonished to make all haste to
pass the required examination and begin her duties.&nbsp; The
county seat was twenty-five miles away, and she made preparations
to start for it the very next morning, her father accompanying
her.&nbsp; Fortunately, that night Dan Gooch brought word to the
Coyle cabin that Mr. Breel, head of the board of examiners, was
at the Settlement and would willingly give Talitha an examination
if she could be on hand the next morning.</p>
<p>With fear and trembling she set forth at dawn the next day to
return at night in triumph.&nbsp; It had not proved so terrible
an ordeal as she had imagined.&nbsp; Mr. Breel had been very kind
and wished her success in her undertaking.</p>
<p>Before Monday morning came, which should see Talitha installed
as mistress of the little school, complications arose in the
shape of Jake Simcox, a tall, fiery-headed, raw-boned
youth.&nbsp; Noting the old schoolmaster&rsquo;s growing
infirmities the past year, he had resolved to secure the
place.&nbsp; That it was about to be wrested from him by a
&ldquo;gal&rdquo; proved too much <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>for human endurance.&nbsp;
Laboriously he travelled from one mountain home to another
pleading his cause.&nbsp; But unfortunately for him, his first
call on Dan Gooch made an implacable enemy, for he thoughtlessly
mentioned the Bentville school in terms of derision, further
adding that &ldquo;Si Quinn, the smartest man in Goose Creek,
didn&rsquo;t need ter chase off ter git larnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jake departed, feeling that he had failed miserably in
making the desired impression.&nbsp; He would have felt still
more convinced that the fates were against him could he have
known that Dan Gooch immediately mounted his horse and set out
with all possible haste to thwart the new candidate&rsquo;s
efforts.</p>
<p>Dan secretly surmised the sacrifice Talitha had made that
Gincy should have her chance, and his gratitude gave him a ready
tongue in the former&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp; It was late that night
when he and his jaded steed returned victorious, for every member
of the board and a number of patrons of the school had been
surprised at the Settlement store, and there Jake Simcox&rsquo;s
cause was lost, it being the opinion of the trustees that the old
schoolmaster had a right to name a substitute for the remainder
of the term.</p>
<p>Jake Simcox did not take his defeat kindly, and to be beaten
by a &ldquo;gal&rdquo; was the bitterest drop in his cup.&nbsp;
He had a brief pleasure in knowing that when Talitha began school
a <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>number
of children whose parents were his adherents would be absent.</p>
<p>The young teacher was gathering her courage to meet the
conditions to which she had been accustomed all her life;
suddenly they appalled her.&nbsp; How could she make that bare
and desolate place cheerful and inviting to her pupils?</p>
<p>Early that Monday morning, long before the time for her
scholars to arrive, she started for the schoolhouse.&nbsp;
Halfway up the slope she paused to consider it&mdash;a small log
cabin set in the midst of blackberry vines and tall, brown weeds
which reached to the eaves.&nbsp; A narrow, worn path led through
the tangle to the low, front door.&nbsp; Talitha hurried on
breathlessly and opened it.&nbsp; The shutter over the one
glassless window at the rear was also thrown back to let a
draught of fresh air through the damp, musty place.&nbsp; In one
corner was a rusty sheet-iron stove, near it a number of plank
benches without backs; while on the opposite side a rude desk and
a single chair completed the furnishings.&nbsp; There were no
blackboards, no maps.&nbsp; The walls were as bare and
uninteresting as when Si Quinn sat in the seat of authority and
ruled his little flock&mdash;she the most timid and shrinking of
them all&mdash;with a rod of iron.</p>
<p>She sat for a long time thinking until a certain project
entered her mind.&nbsp; It was something to be carefully
considered.&nbsp; She sprang <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>up and filled a tin can with water
for the flowers and reddening vines she had gathered on the way,
and placed it on her desk.&nbsp; Next, a large picture calendar
was pinned to the wall and several pictures from a newspaper
supplement&mdash;a part of her possessions acquired at
Bentville.</p>
<p>A stream of sunlight through the open window lighted the gay
colours on walls and desk.&nbsp; The children hovered about the
door in amazement until they were bidden to enter.&nbsp; They
were all small but Billy Gooch, the eldest, who was short and
stocky for his fourteen years and quite prepared to be his young
teacher&rsquo;s most zealous champion.</p>
<p>The feeling of timidity with which Talitha began her duties
vanished before the morning was over; and in its place was a
great anxiety to help her pupils and make more attractive the
cheerless place which only a wide stretch of the imagination
could call a schoolhouse.&nbsp; The latter seemed an
impossibility, but when she reached the creek path that night on
her way home, she found Dan Gooch waiting for her, eager for the
earliest news of the day&rsquo;s proceedings.&nbsp; To this
sympathetic listener she told her needs and plans.&nbsp; He heard
her to the end with a silent gravity which gave little sign of
encouragement, but at dawn the next morning, Dan was in the
saddle wending his way to the Settlement store.&nbsp; The flitch
of bacon in his saddlebag had been secretly purloined <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>from the
family&rsquo;s scanty store to be bartered for a few lengths of
sawed timber and a small quantity of black paint.&nbsp; Dan
correctly surmising that the storekeeper, being a patron of the
school, would add his own contribution in the way of generous
measure beside the nails and loan of a hammer.</p>
<p>A few days later when Talitha entered the schoolroom, two
large blackboards nailed securely to the rough walls met her
astonished eyes.&nbsp; Si Quinn had never been able to evoke the
interest which had so suddenly been aroused in the Goose Creek
school.</p>
<p>The secret which the young teacher had so patiently guarded
for weeks was at last revealed in the shape of maps and several
much needed books.&nbsp; A bundle of papers and magazines from
the Bentville school was a welcome addition to Talitha&rsquo;s
slender stock of material.&nbsp; A lump rose in Dan Gooch&rsquo;s
throat as he helped her unpack the box from the city publishing
house and hang the maps where the best light from the window
would fall upon them.&nbsp; No words were needed to tell him that
a large part of the money, hoarded so carefully for
Talitha&rsquo;s expenses at Bentville, had been spent in their
purchase, and three of his children would be benefited by
them.&nbsp; Mentally he resolved that it should all be returned
to her some day in good measure.</p>
<p>Si Quinn was not ignorant of his former pupil&rsquo;s
successes.&nbsp; As often as his health <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>permitted he
hobbled up the winding path and sat contentedly, like a happy
child, listening to the young teacher explaining things of which
he had never heard.&nbsp; At times he would shake his head in
bewilderment, but he never disputed her word, even when his most
cherished theory&mdash;that the earth was square&mdash;was
disproved.&nbsp; His dulled brain failed to grasp the
explanation, but the bigoted faith in his own meagre stock of
knowledge died pitifully away.</p>
<p>Jake Simcox also was not unmindful of his rival&rsquo;s
success as a teacher.&nbsp; With increasing anger he heard her
praises sounded.&nbsp; Already his friends had yielded to their
children&rsquo;s entreaties and sent them to school.&nbsp; Jake
kept aloof from the place until one day, wandering idly across
the foothills, he came suddenly in full view of the schoolhouse
perched on the side of Red Mountain.&nbsp; Its worn,
weather-beaten logs looked ancient enough against the
autumn-tinted foliage.&nbsp; As he looked, the scowl on his face
deepened.&nbsp; He hesitated a moment, then took the trail toward
it.&nbsp; The place would be deserted for it was long past school
time; there was not a house in sight, still he approached it
cautiously with sly, furtive glances around.</p>
<p>Before he reached the building he could see that the weeds and
blackberry bushes had been exterminated, and in their places were
broad-leaved ferns planted close to the rough sides, <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>and a healthy
ivy that in another year would give both grace and beauty to the
walls.&nbsp; Jake eyed these changes with a sneer.&nbsp; He tried
the door; it was locked, an unheard-of thing which he also
resented.&nbsp; After much effort he unfastened the shutter,
threw it back, and sprang into the room.</p>
<p>The light of the setting sun streamed in broad shafts over the
crest of the mountain straight into the schoolhouse and illumined
it to the farthest corner.&nbsp; The autumn flowers and vines on
the desk glowed crimson.&nbsp; The blackboards, maps, and
pictures had transformed the place; it was bare no longer.&nbsp;
A pail of water on a box, with a basin, towel, and soap, was
another innovation.</p>
<p>Secretly, Jake Simcox felt himself dwindle and grow small
before such superior knowledge, yet it only served to rouse him
to greater indignation that a &ldquo;gal&rdquo; should be better
qualified to teach than he.&nbsp; Striding to the desk he turned
the leaves of the text-books Talitha cherished so carefully, with
a rough hand, shaking his head over the bewildering pages.&nbsp;
Naturally impetuous, his fiery temper once thoroughly aroused
swept him away in unreasoning wrath.&nbsp; At last he dropped
upon a bench, moodily taking note of every object around him
until they seemed seared into his memory.</p>
<p>The sun sank behind the mountain&rsquo;s crest <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>and the long
shadows deepened down the slopes.&nbsp; They crept silently in at
the open window and filled the room with gloom, and still he
huddled there frowning until only a faint, grey light struggled
at the square opening.&nbsp; Then Jake moved slightly.&nbsp; Two
forces were wrestling within him&mdash;one very feebly, now worn
out with the unequal conflict.&nbsp; He sprang up, and, listening
at every step, closed the shutter cautiously and struck a
match.&nbsp; There was a basket of pine cones and crisp leaves
behind the stove.&nbsp; He lifted the lid and thrust them
in.&nbsp; Another match and the mass was ablaze.&nbsp; Recklessly
the wood from a generous box full was thrown upon it, and then in
the midst of this furnace of flame hastily, as though his
conscience would smite him in the act, he caught the books from
the desk and threw them upon the pile.&nbsp; The pictures from
the walls followed, the maps&mdash;what he could tear off in
great clinging shreds&mdash;were also added to the holocaust.</p>
<p>The stove was red hot by this time and roaring like a young
volcano.&nbsp; The miscreant burned his fingers putting on the
cover, and then it glowered at him like a red monster as he
watched it.&nbsp; Already his rage was somewhat cooled; the
provocation which had led to such a deed began to look miserably
small.&nbsp; He looked around at the bared walls and wished he
could put everything back as he found it.</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>But
instead of dying down the fire seemed to wax hotter; there was a
snapping and crackling in the short length of pipe.&nbsp; A
strange smell suddenly pervaded the place which the frightened
Jake knew was the mud and stick chimney.&nbsp; It was afire, and
while he stared in consternation, he heard it crumble and
fall.</p>
<p>For a moment the young fellow stood rooted to the spot.&nbsp;
In his thirst for revenge he had committed a most serious
offence, for which the mountaineers&mdash;a law unto
themselves&mdash;would not hesitate to mete out a swift
punishment.&nbsp; The cabin was doomed.&nbsp; The flames had
leaped to the roof; the stovepipe reeled and hung tipsily, ready
to drop in a moment.</p>
<p>Terror stricken, Jake Simcox flung back the shutter and leaped
out into the darkness.&nbsp; Like some wild thing of the
mountains he fled down the slope, on and on, only looking back
once to see forked tongues of light against the sky reaching
higher and higher, until a swift, illumining flash told that the
great pine behind the little schoolhouse had caught fire, and
like a signal torch was blazing his shameful deed to all the
mountains.&nbsp; Where could he go to escape the
consequences?</p>
<p>He turned toward a thicket of young trees to aid his escape,
but as he reached it a lumbering body emerged and proceeded
leisurely toward the creek, the measured jingle of a bell marking
every step.</p>
<h2><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>VI<br

HUNTING A VARMINT</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Supper</span> was late at the Gooch
cabin.&nbsp; Brindled Bess, who daily supplied a large portion of
the evening meal, had strayed farther away than usual.&nbsp; For
more than an hour Billy and his sister had been searching the
mountain-side.</p>
<p>From his doorstep Dan looked gloomily forth into the fast
gathering night.&nbsp; If the animal, suddenly startled at the
brink of a ledge, had leaped over, it would be a sore calamity to
the family.&nbsp; Dan listened to the clatter of dishes inside
the cabin until hunger and suspense overcame him.&nbsp; He
started up and with rapid strides disappeared across the mountain
in a haste entirely foreign to his habits.</p>
<p>Both eye and ear were keenly alert.&nbsp; There was a strange,
coppery glow on the eastern horizon.&nbsp; It reached far above
the treetops, lurid and threatening against the soft blue of the
evening sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some foolish feller&rsquo;s let his bresh fire git away
from him, I reckon,&rdquo; commented Dan.&nbsp; But he went on
without hearing a sound save those of the night.</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>Suddenly, there was a crackling of bushes above the
creek path, the thud of hurried, stumbling steps.&nbsp; They came
nearer until he could hear panting breaths, and Sudie was flying
past him white-faced, wild-eyed, her hair streaming out like a
frightened dryad of the mountains.</p>
<p>Dan caught roughly at her arm, and but for his grip she would
have fallen in terror.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter?&nbsp; Whar&rsquo;s thet cow critter?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>Sudie struggled with her sobs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, pappy, the
schoolhouse is afire!&nbsp; Hit&rsquo;s
all-burnin&rsquo;-up!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; ejaculated her father in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit shore is,&rdquo; asseverated Billy, coming up
red-faced and panting.&nbsp; &ldquo;We war a-headin&rsquo; the
cow critter this way when we seen the fire a-bustin&rsquo;
out&rsquo;n the roof.&nbsp; Hit&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Dan had not waited to hear more.&nbsp; He was sprinting in the
direction of the schoolhouse like a boy.&nbsp; His children
watched him for a moment in open-mouthed astonishment at such
unheard-of alacrity on their father&rsquo;s part, then
followed.</p>
<p>A good quarter of a mile brought him in plain sight of the
burning building, where he could plainly see the futility of
further effort.&nbsp; The little schoolhouse was a mass of flame,
but the old, well-seasoned logs would burn for hours yet.&nbsp;
Fortunately the heavy shower of the morning prevented the flames
from <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>spreading, the weeds and bushes had been so thoroughly
cleared away.&nbsp; Only the sentinel pine at the back of the
cabin was doomed.</p>
<p>Sudie clung to her father, sobbing wildly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll Tally say?&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t never go to
school no more,&rdquo; she wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hesh, honey, hit don&rsquo;t do no good ter take on
thet a-way,&rdquo; urged Dan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Somebody must hev been
mighty keerless with matches or the like ter hev fired hit.&nbsp;
I reckoned Tally&rsquo;d hed more sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit warn&rsquo;t her,&rdquo; Billy burst out, anxious
to vindicate his teacher.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hit war thet Jake Simcox,
I&rsquo;ll be boun&rsquo;.&nbsp; Jest as we hove in sight of the
place I seen him a-scootin&rsquo; fer the pines like a painter
war after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The low-down, sneakin&rsquo; varmint!&nbsp;
Thet&rsquo;s jest who did hit, and he &rsquo;lowed not ter git
ketched in the night time.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll git larned
better.&nbsp; The dark&rsquo;ll kiver a heap o&rsquo; things, but
no sech deed as this.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the fierceness that lies
smouldering in the nature of the average mountain man leaped into
as fierce a flame as that consuming the little schoolhouse.&nbsp;
His younger children&rsquo;s opportunities had been snatched from
them by this miscreant.&nbsp; He should not escape&mdash;a swift,
deserved punishment should be meted out to this offender as only
mountain men could measure it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run home, Sudie, and tell your mammy she&rsquo;ll hev
ter tend ter the cow critter ter-night, <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>me and Billy
won&rsquo;t be back fer a spell.&nbsp; Thar&rsquo;s a heap ter be
done before mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father&rsquo;s ominous tone startled Billy.&nbsp; It
brought to memory stories he had heard of the Twilliger and Amyx
feuds&mdash;his mother was a Twilliger.&nbsp; He trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; said Dan as Sudie disappeared, &ldquo;do
you &rsquo;low you can make the Coyle place ter-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so,&rdquo; answered Billy, bravely trying to
forget that it was long past his supper time.&nbsp; Mountain
justice never waited on hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clip up thar and back as soon as you kin, and tell Sam
Coyle fer me, thet we shall expect ter see him at the Forks
ter-morrow mornin&rsquo; by light, ter hunt varmints.&nbsp; They
may hev left the kentry, but we&rsquo;ll smoke &rsquo;em out if
they&rsquo;re ter be found.&nbsp; Kin you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Pappy&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; ter the Twilligers.&nbsp; I
kin git the boys ter push on to the Settlemint, and then the
news&rsquo;ll carry fast enough, I reckon,&rdquo; and father and
son parted.</p>
<p>At daybreak the Forks was the scene of an assembling of the
clans.&nbsp; Old scores were forgotten.&nbsp; They were meeting
in a common cause which had suddenly endeared itself to
all.&nbsp; Not one of the older men but had children among
Tally&rsquo;s flock, and they had begun to realize what the
school had meant to them.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>Nearly
all of the company were horseback, but every member carried a
&ldquo;shooting iron,&rdquo; a fact which had its own
significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could hev took after thet varmint last night, I
reckon we could hev treed him,&rdquo; said Eli Twilliger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But he&rsquo;d be a plumb fool if he warn&rsquo;t out of
the kentry by this time.&nbsp; Hit&rsquo;s a mighty good thing he
hasn&rsquo;t any kin in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them long legs of his&rsquo;n could take him
cornsiderable fur, but he hasn&rsquo;t any hoss critter ter save
his strength.&nbsp; I reckon he ain&rsquo;t out of reach
yit.&nbsp; He never war no great hand ter exert hisself, Jake
warn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; drawled the blacksmith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; further off while
we&rsquo;re argefyin&rsquo;,&rdquo; objected Dan Gooch
testily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I &rsquo;low hit&rsquo;s time we war
gittin&rsquo; down ter bizness.&nbsp; Some of you fellers take
the trails &rsquo;tween you, and Sam and I&rsquo;ll go
&rsquo;long the creek.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll meet whar the old
schoolhouse war, and if you&rsquo;ve run down any game you kin
bring hit along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock the party straggled in from different
directions empty-handed.&nbsp; Eli Twilliger was the last
one.&nbsp; His had been a hard, rough climb.&nbsp; Thin and wiry,
sure of foot as a wild cat, and as ready to pounce upon the
object of his search, not a man knew so well the hiding places
those mighty hills afforded.&nbsp; His shirt was torn, his hands
and face bore scratches received in a careful search through <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>the narrow
subterranean passages which honeycombed the cliffs.&nbsp; Tired
and hungry, he was in an ugly mood as with long strides he made
toward the group gathered at the edge of the pine thicket.</p>
<p>Dan Gooch turned toward him with a warning finger which he
resented.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s do-in&rsquo;?&rdquo; he
growled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hev you caged the varmint and air
makin&rsquo; a show of him?&rdquo;&nbsp; He peered curiously over
the intervening shoulders and was suddenly silenced.</p>
<p>In sight of the charred, smouldering ruins from which still
issued little puffs of smoke, Talitha, nothing daunted by her ill
fortune, had gathered her little flock.&nbsp; Smiles had begun to
cover their tear-stained faces.&nbsp; It was a delightful novelty
to sit on that mossy, sun-flecked bank and prepare the
day&rsquo;s lessons.&nbsp; Billy Gooch shared his large slate
with the youngest of the Twilligers, and two small girls bent
industriously over the same book.</p>
<p>The eyes of the rough mountaineers moistened, their hands
tightened upon their rifles ominously.&nbsp; There was a stir
among the foremost, and Si Quinn faced them.&nbsp; His face was
like a thunder cloud.&nbsp; One crutch waved so threateningly
that those nearest shrank back.&nbsp; &ldquo;What air you
goin&rsquo; ter do &rsquo;bout hit?&nbsp; Thet&rsquo;s what I
want ter ask.&nbsp; You might hev knowed you couldn&rsquo;t ketch
that feller; he wan&rsquo;t brung up in the mountings fer
nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Hit was as big a piece of devilment as I
ever <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>heerd
of, but mebbe hit won&rsquo;t be the worst thing could hev
happened, except fer the leetle gal losin&rsquo; the money she
put inter hit.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go ter work and put up
somethin&rsquo; thet won&rsquo;t shame us.&nbsp; You-all know
thet old shack warn&rsquo;t no way fitten fer a
schoolhouse.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help you ter cut a stick of
timber much as I&rsquo;d give fer the strength ter do hit, but
I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;nough ter make up fer all Tally
lost&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho now, Si, we ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter let you do
hit,&rdquo; interrupted the blacksmith.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
jest count your advice wuth thet much, and I reckon hit
air.&nbsp; If we ain&rsquo;t robustious &rsquo;nough ter put up
another schoolhouse and git what Tally needs for our young-uns, I
&rsquo;low we&rsquo;re a sorry lot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you do go on, Enoch,&rdquo; jibed Eli Twilliger,
pushing his way to the front.&nbsp; &ldquo;Air you
intendin&rsquo; ter take the stump fer the next
&rsquo;lection?&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s git down ter bizness.&nbsp;
Thar ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; I can see ter hinder us from
startin&rsquo; ter-morrow mornin&rsquo;, and if the weather is
fair Tally shall hev her schoolhouse in two weeks.&nbsp;
Ain&rsquo;t thet so, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer, a shout went up that started the echoes from their
hiding-places in the hills.&nbsp; Talitha and her flock looked up
at them wonderingly.&nbsp; She was too far away to comprehend
what good fortune was to be hers, but she could rejoice that
something had restored the men to good humour.&nbsp; Greater than
sorrow at the frustrating of her plans and the <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>loss in which
her small savings had been invested, was her horror at the
revival of the old feud spirit.&nbsp; She had learned at the
Bentville school the terribleness of it.&nbsp; In agony she had
watched her father the previous night as he cleaned and loaded
his rifle.&nbsp; Jake Simcox had done a despicable, cowardly
thing, but she could not wish him dealt with according to the
code of mountain justice.</p>
<p>At noon she sent the children home and walked slowly beside
the schoolmaster.&nbsp; There were many questions she wished to
ask him, but she kept silent, knowing that he would speak of his
own accord or not at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit war jest as I &rsquo;lowed,&rdquo; he said at
last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jake took time by the forelock and mighty well
he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad they didn&rsquo;t find
him!&rdquo; exclaimed Talitha in a tone that struck the
schoolmaster oddly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s thet, leetle gal!&nbsp; Mighty queer talk
fer the gran&rsquo;darter of a Bills.&rdquo;&nbsp; The faded eyes
twinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, it isn&rsquo;t right; and
it&rsquo;s a terrible thing for folks to remember all their
lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pore leetle gal,&rdquo; the old man nodded
understandingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You warn&rsquo;t bigger&rsquo;n
Sudie, I reckon, time o&rsquo; the Amyx shootin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twar a shame ter saddle you with sech
mem&rsquo;ries.&nbsp; I never did hev much use fer sech
doin&rsquo;s, and I said so, but hit warn&rsquo;t a grain
o&rsquo; use.&nbsp; You <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>might jest as well talk ter a passel
of hounds arter a Bushy tail.&nbsp; But chirk up, you won&rsquo;t
see Jake in these parts agin.&nbsp; What we&rsquo;re most
consarned &rsquo;bout now is whar you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; ter
keep school when the ugly weather comes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had come to the parting of the ways, and here Talitha
left the old man hobbling painfully toward his cabin.</p>
<p>Si Quinn&rsquo;s progress homeward was slow.&nbsp; He stopped
now and then to regain his breath and chuckle feebly to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon she thinks I&rsquo;ve a heart of
stun ter take hit so ca&rsquo;m, but I &rsquo;low Jake Simcox
didn&rsquo;t do sech a bad thing.&nbsp; Hit war worse fer hisself
than fer Goose Creek.&nbsp; Law, what&rsquo;ll the gal say when
she hears of hit!&nbsp; I reckon I&rsquo;d better be
sendin&rsquo; fer them school fixin&rsquo;s
ter-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had reached the cabin door, and now
he shuffled inside, closing it carefully.&nbsp; Shadowed by
pines, the place was always gloomy enough even at mid-day with
the shutters thrown wide.&nbsp; Now he uncovered the coals on the
hearth, laid on a few small sticks, and swung the battered old
tea kettle over the blaze.&nbsp; Then he drew up his chair cosily
before it, and thrusting his hand into his trousers&rsquo; pocket
brought forth a small leather bag.&nbsp; From it he counted a
number of bills, smoothing each one tenderly across his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall hev &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said aloud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do without somehow, and hit won&rsquo;t be fer
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>long.&nbsp; The old man&rsquo;s nearin&rsquo; the end of
the trail&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He glanced around uneasily, with a
vague consciousness of something&mdash;he knew not what.&nbsp; In
the far corner of the cabin a pair of eyes, bloodshot and wild,
glared at him from under a thatch of red hair.</p>
<p>The old man grasped the money.&nbsp; It disappeared in his
shirt as he staggered to his feet and faced the intruder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afeard, I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
ter tech hit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The figure issued from the corner
lamely.&nbsp; In the light it was still more forbidding.&nbsp; A
bruise on the forehead made a disfiguring, parti-coloured lump on
his otherwise pale, drawn face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t teched
a thing, not even a crumb, tho&rsquo; I&rsquo;m &rsquo;most
famished,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, you crazy loon!&rdquo;&nbsp; Si Quinn raised a
warning finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, yes, I know,&rdquo; sneered the young fellow
recklessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dogs air arter the wolf and they kin
hev him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He threw up his arms wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set down in thet cheer and be still,&rdquo; commanded
the old man.</p>
<p>Jake dropped obediently into a seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;lowed you war out&rsquo;n the kentry.&nbsp;
Why didn&rsquo;t you make tracks when you had a
chanct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did aim ter,&rdquo; answered Jake Simcox, &ldquo;but
I fell, crawlin&rsquo; over thet ledge by the Gulch, and I
didn&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; till this <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>mornin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I could hear the men
thrashin&rsquo; the bushes all &rsquo;round me, but I was jest
out of sight of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I wish fer the land they&rsquo;d
tuk me then and thar and done with hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way of a transgressor is shorely hard,&rdquo;
exclaimed the old man pityingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go fer ter fire the place, Si, I shore
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I jest thought ter burn the books and
sech.&nbsp; Oh, I don&rsquo;t know what made me do hit,
&rsquo;less I was plumb crazy!&rdquo;&nbsp; Jake bowed his head
in his hands and groaned in agony.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster set the coffee pot upon the coals, where it
simmered gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sho now, Jake,&rdquo; he said
kindly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re all beat out.&nbsp; Draw up and hev a
bite; hit ain&rsquo;t much but hit&rsquo;ll put some heart in
you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t cornsider thet jest burnin&rsquo; thet
old shack war sech a turrible sin; hit war the sperit you done
hit in.&nbsp; You did &rsquo;low to burn all thet pore gal spent
most of her savin&rsquo;s on, and thet was the meanest part of
the hull bizness.&nbsp; I allers said thet temper of yours would
bring you ter grief.&nbsp; Hit&rsquo;s like a skeery hoss
critter; when hit gits loose you never can cal&rsquo;late on all
the didos hit&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ter cut up.&nbsp; Do you think
thet if you hed another chanct you hev got grit &rsquo;nough ter
turn &rsquo;round in your tracks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake reached a hand over the table and grasped the hard,
shrivelled one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I shore would if I could only
hev hit,&rdquo; he <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>answered humbly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shore would, but
hit&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; contradicted the old man
cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;So long as you see the error of your
ways, I&rsquo;ll see thet you git out of this bizness
hopin&rsquo; hit&rsquo;s a lesson you won&rsquo;t
forgit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until Jake Simcox was able both mentally and physically to
make the journey, he remained in the schoolmaster&rsquo;s cabin,
hiding away in the little loft at the least sign of danger.</p>
<p>Late the third night after a hearty supper, Si Quinn filled
his knapsack with provisions and slung it across the young
shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hike over the Ohiar line as quick as you
kin,&rdquo; he admonished, &ldquo;and then find a job near a
school whar you kin git some larnin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; ter give you this,&rdquo; putting a bill in the young
fellow&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hit&rsquo;ll help you out till
you git work, if you&rsquo;re savin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d make
hit more, but most of the rest is goin&rsquo; fer books and maps
fer Tally&rsquo;s new schoolhouse they&rsquo;re buildin&rsquo;
fer her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake looked up shamefacedly; the money seemed to burn his
hand, but to what straits might he be brought if he refused
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay hit all back&mdash;every
cent,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;and I shan&rsquo;t ever fergit
what you&rsquo;ve done fer me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he was swallowed
up by the darkness.</p>

THE JAM SOCIAL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tiny, blue calcimined room with
one window looking southward seemed almost palatial in comparison
with Gincy&rsquo;s humble home quarters.&nbsp; Instead of the
overhanging mountains were the foothills and the college
gardens.</p>
<p>She tried to picture the scene back home without her at this
early hour.&nbsp; Her mother milking Brindled Bet, Billy feeding
the pigs, and her father&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t be thankful
enough he wasn&rsquo;t like Sam Coyle&mdash;getting ready to
gather the &ldquo;crap&rdquo; in the south cove.</p>
<p>There was a slight stirring in the lower berth of the
double-decker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Talitha,&rdquo; she called out
softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Air you awake?&rdquo;&nbsp; But the voice
which answered was not Talitha&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Urilla,&rdquo; it said hesitatingly.</p>
<p>Gincy leaned over and her eyes sought the occupant of the cot
below.&nbsp; Propped up on the pillow was the pale face of the
girl who had arrived yesterday.&nbsp; The solemn brown eyes
looked straight up into hers inquiringly as though not at all
sure of a welcome.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;re some
surprised,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>&ldquo;You were asleep when I came in
last night and I aimed to keep pretty still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Gincy rather dazed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But whar&rsquo;s Talitha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urilla shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Donnelly sent me
here&mdash;I had this room last term.&nbsp; I reckon
Talitha&rsquo;s on this floor, though.&nbsp; The first and second
year girls are mostly together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy swung down and began dressing without another
word.&nbsp; She would interview Talitha at breakfast; perhaps
they could arrange to room together after all.&nbsp; Urilla
looked too sober for a roommate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whar you
from?&rdquo; Gincy asked finally, rolling up her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackson County,&rdquo; Urilla answered promptly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I rode twenty miles yesterday and the road was might
rocky.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over in Clay,&rdquo; Gincy smiled into the tired face
as she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d be plumb
tickled to be back.&nbsp; Seems like you couldn&rsquo;t stay away
from here nohow, but I heerd you say your mammy war sick,&rdquo;
she added, anxious not to appear lacking in friendly
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bed sick, or I couldn&rsquo;t have come.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s up, but I keep studying about her and wondering if
Sallie&mdash;that&rsquo;s my next sister&mdash;will keep her from
working.&nbsp; Mother&rsquo;s had a spell of fever and
don&rsquo;t seem to get strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>Apparently, Urilla was fumbling in the little trunk on
the floor for some article of wearing apparel, but Gincy saw the
teardrops, and instantly her tender heart warmed.&nbsp; She
stooped over and took the pale face between her two hard little
palms.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t fret, honey, mammy had the
fever a couple of years back, and she&rsquo;s robustious as kin
be now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urilla looked the thanks her lips were unable to speak.&nbsp;
In a minute she had regained her composure, and by the time the
breakfast bell sounded, her few belongings were carefully hung in
her half of the little closet, the bedclothes airing, and the
tiny dresser in perfect order.</p>
<p>Together they went down the long flights of stairs, but not to
the same dining-room.&nbsp; Gincy had been assigned to a table in
the Annex where Martin and Talitha ate, but the latter had not
arrived.&nbsp; Silently she waited for the blessing, and then
catching Martin&rsquo;s eye, &ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s Talitha?&rdquo;
she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;exactly,&rdquo; he answered
with hesitation and truthfully, he thought.&nbsp; She might be
anywhere between Clover Bottom and Lost Creek by this time.</p>
<p>Gincy ate her oatmeal without suspicion.&nbsp; Why should
Martin know after all, when he roomed halfway across the
campus?&nbsp; Another thought came to her.&nbsp; Perhaps Talitha
had volunteered to go to one of the cottages that <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>she might
stay in the hall.&nbsp; It was just like her to be so
unselfish.</p>
<p>This was the morning for registering, and Gincy felt very new
indeed.&nbsp; In the absence of Talitha, Urilla and Kizzie Tipton
offered to act as escorts.&nbsp; It seemed hours before her end
of the line reached the desk and she was assigned to an
examination in the Industrial Building a block away.&nbsp; Her
sunny face was quite woe-begone as they started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret,&rdquo; admonished Urilla.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know just how you feel, but you needn&rsquo;t be
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m plumb &rsquo;shamed of my ignorance.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t be nowhar &rsquo;side of you-all,&rdquo; Gincy
answered disconsolately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be just where I was last year,&rdquo;
consoled Kizzie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you reckon so?&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m bound ter work
every minnit now I&rsquo;ve got started.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Gincy&rsquo;s mouth showed an even line of determination.&nbsp;
She looked around curiously as they entered the big, brick
building.&nbsp; On either side of the wide stairway were the
rooms for cooking and sewing.&nbsp; Students were passing in and
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had cooking,&rdquo; said Urilla, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ve taught Sallie to make good bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather take sewing; it&rsquo;s
easier.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kizzie&rsquo;s black eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had my ruthers it would be cookin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
<a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>declared
Gincy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could help mammy a heap; hit&rsquo;s better
to move &rsquo;round some, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A crowd was constantly passing up and down the stairs leading
to the second floor.&nbsp; Some of the boys and girls had yellow
slips in their hands; a few looked worried.&nbsp; In the large,
upstairs classrooms there was a sprinkling of parents.&nbsp; Many
had come a score of miles with ox teams and stood around
anxiously awaiting the result of the examination.</p>
<p>All new pupils were assigned to Room 2, and here Gincy
discovered Abner, his yellow head bent over a sheet of paper
covered with figures.&nbsp; Gincy regarded him with
confidence.&nbsp; Abner was strong in arithmetic&mdash;the one
study the mountain teachers had impressed upon their
pupils.&nbsp; For herself she was not so sure.&nbsp; Her
knowledge of geography was hazy.&nbsp; In grammar the parts of
speech had been carefully reviewed, but she was in doubt about
parsing, and diagramming looked to her like a jumble of words
tumbling over a precarious footing of loose boards.&nbsp; She
dropped into a vacant seat near the door while Urilla looked for
a teacher who was not too busy to interview her.&nbsp; Presently,
she returned, and Gincy found herself shaking hands with an
attractive young woman whose near-sighted brown eyes held the
friendliest look in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to meet you, Miss Gooch; you&rsquo;re
from Clay County?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find a good <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>many boys and
girls from there.&nbsp; Urilla told me all about you at breakfast
time and we&rsquo;re going to help you get acquainted.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll be one of my specials on the third floor, I can tell
that by looking at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy&rsquo;s heart took sudden courage.&nbsp; If all the
teachers were going to be like Miss Howard she certainly would be
a &ldquo;special&rdquo; if she had to study all night to
accomplish it.&nbsp; Miss Howard sat close and questioned her
softly, not seeming to mind when she stumbled or failed
entirely.&nbsp; Gincy had a musical voice and read the easy
selections in a way which pleased the teacher, for she
recommended elocution and sub-normal arithmetic on the little
slip which Gincy bore away an hour later.&nbsp; The other studies
were not wholly settled, but it seemed like a good beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to come to the Jam Social to-night,&rdquo; had
been Miss Howard&rsquo;s parting words, and Gincy had promised
readily, although not feeling at all sure what a &ldquo;Jam
Social&rdquo; really was.</p>
<p>She wandered around from one building to another, nowhere
encountering Talitha or any one who had seen her.&nbsp; Once
inside the Hall again she went straight to the office to question
Mrs. Donnelly.</p>
<p>From behind a desk piled high with mail, the dean answered,
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone home, Miss Gooch.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>&ldquo;Gone home!&nbsp; When?&rdquo;&nbsp; Gincy&rsquo;s
voice sounded strange to her own ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two o&rsquo;clock this morning.&nbsp; She slept
with me last night and Martin saw her off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&nbsp; Was any one sick&mdash;or?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The dean shook her head and began to open her mail.&nbsp;
Suddenly Gincy knew it all.&nbsp; Talitha had gone that she might
stay.&nbsp; After working so hard, too.&nbsp; What would Sam
Coyle say to her?&nbsp; Not willing to make any sacrifices
himself&mdash;for his children&rsquo;s good&mdash;he would be
angry to have them generous with others.&nbsp; Gincy turned and
went up to her room.&nbsp; How could she accept such a
sacrifice?&nbsp; She wrestled with the problem for hours, then in
despair thought of Miss Howard.&nbsp; The little teacher listened
patiently with one soft hand covering the girl&rsquo;s
work-roughened one.&nbsp; When Gincy had ended with a sob in her
voice, Miss Howard&rsquo;s arm stole around her and held her
close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, dear, Talitha will come back to us
some time.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s determined to have an
education.&nbsp; She has chosen to give you your chance now; make
the very best of it.&nbsp; It would be foolish for you to start
home and disappoint her&mdash;it would be useless, too.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s going to write you in a day or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat comforted, Gincy went back to her room.&nbsp; On
every side doors were ajar and girls unpacking.&nbsp; There was
the merry <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>chatter of friends long separated, and those newly
found, which sent a delightful glow through the heart of the
mountain girl.&nbsp; Few and far between were the opportunities
for sociability back in the hills, and as she realized what she
was gaining, a keen sense of Talitha&rsquo;s loss smote her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get ready for the Social before
dinner,&rdquo; a voice called out from behind, and Kizzie
overtook Gincy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call for you and Urilla
promptly at seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten hit, sure enough,&rdquo; answered
Gincy, quickening her steps.</p>
<p>Early in the evening the large chapel blazed forth a welcome
to the returning students from its many windows.&nbsp; From every
direction they came&mdash;in groups or singly.&nbsp; Above, was a
starlit sky, and the air was full of a soft, sweet melody unlike
anything Gincy had ever heard before.&nbsp; Her ears, used only
to the thrum of the banjo, or a crude performance on a small reed
organ, were thrilled with delight as the college band finished
the overture from &ldquo;William Tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced shyly at Urilla to see if her emotion was shared,
but the quiet face betrayed nothing more than deep satisfaction
at being once more among her beloved schoolmates.</p>
<p>The great auditorium was filling rapidly.&nbsp; Happy faces
peered down from the galleries, girls and boys elbowed their way
past, calling <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>out hearty greetings to those they recognized.&nbsp;
There was a short lull when the president made his welcoming
speech; after that, it seemed to Gincy a thousand hives had
swarmed.&nbsp; Abner and Martin caught the spirit at once and
moved constantly from one group to another shaking hands,
exchanging jokes, and growing merrier each moment.&nbsp; Gincy
watched them astonished.&nbsp; Abner&rsquo;s light hair was
tossed back like a mane, his cheeks were rosy, his eyes alight
with fun.&nbsp; Martin took it more quietly, but never had she
seen such a look of pleasure in his face.</p>
<p>Gincy forgot her plain dress&mdash;plain even in comparison
with the simple clothes around her&mdash;and the fact that she
was surrounded by hundreds of strange faces.&nbsp; The spirit of
youth&mdash;so often quenched in these young mountain people
before it fairly shows itself&mdash;was clamouring for
expression.&nbsp; She drew a long breath and decided to be one of
the gay company.</p>
<p>An hour later as the three girls emerged from the building
which the bell in the tower had suddenly hushed, Gincy felt that
she had come into her own.&nbsp; Her timidity had vanished, and a
pleasant presage of popularity made her innocently merry and once
more her own natural self.</p>
<h2><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>VIII<br />
THE MASTER KEY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was nearly time for the rising
bell, and Gincy propped herself up on one elbow to watch the
light creeping above the foothills and the ox teams crawling
along Big Hill pike.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she remembered her new duties as monitor of the
third floor.&nbsp; It was so hard lately to keep order during
study hours and after the last bell at night.&nbsp; Gincy could
not help connecting it in some way with Nancy Jane Ping and
Mallie Green, the two recent arrivals from her own county.&nbsp;
They had been reproved time and again for an untidy room, but it
seemed to do no good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re always studyin&rsquo; up some foolishness
to keep things upset,&rdquo; she declared disgustedly.&nbsp;
Gincy had been feeling particularly lonely now that Urilla had
gone home for a whole week; things had been happening, too.&nbsp;
Miss Howard was at her wit&rsquo;s end to discover the offenders,
so sly were they, but Kizzie Tipton and Lalla Ponder were always
the victims.</p>
<p>Sometimes the bedding was piled in a heap <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>in the middle
of the floor, or Lalla&rsquo;s school hat was filled with water
and her best dress missing only to be found later folded under
the mattress.&nbsp; The vandals covered their tracks very neatly,
and Miss Howard, knowing the excitable temperaments around her,
kept the matter as quiet as possible.</p>
<p>Gincy thought it over carefully until breakfast time, then
decided to do some special detective work for the reputation of
the Hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some fracas between their kin, I
reckon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gincy was used to the mountain feuds, which,
like a slumbering fire, always broke out in unexpected
places.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mallie&rsquo;s been left to run till
she&rsquo;s no &rsquo;count; why don&rsquo;t she study to get
some learnin&rsquo; stid o&rsquo; hatchin&rsquo; up
deviltry?&nbsp; Nancy Jane and she make a team; looks like they
don&rsquo;t show good sense.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gincy shook her head
sadly, thinking how hard she had worked for the privilege which
others esteemed so lightly.&nbsp; School had meant for her
sacrifice, and long hours of toil.</p>
<p>Saturday was a busy day in the Hall.&nbsp; Its many corridors
were thoroughly swept and mopped, the rooms carefully
cleaned.&nbsp; Gincy was here and there and everywhere on the
third floor.&nbsp; By lunch time there was a sharp twinge in her
left ear which sent the blood throbbing to her temples.&nbsp; Her
own room was spotless.&nbsp; Urilla&rsquo;s family photographs
were tucked in the wire rack where they would show to the best
advantage, the ugly ink spot <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>on the chenille table spread was
turned to the wall, and the small stove was shining.&nbsp; But
the occupant was not tempted by odours of fresh gingerbread or
turnip salad coming from below.&nbsp; Her work for the day was
done.&nbsp; She had counted on going to Lee&rsquo;s Knob with a
walking party for a picnic supper.&nbsp; Suddenly, all ambition
had left her.&nbsp; When she awoke from her long nap her earache
was gone, but there lingered in her memory a curious dream.&nbsp;
The room key had been stolen and Miss Howard was in trouble.</p>
<p>Another bell rang.&nbsp; This time it was for dinner, but
Gincy still felt little inclination to move, and a curious
absence of hunger.&nbsp; There were loitering feet, then
hurrying, then the distant clatter from the Annex announced that
the meal was in progress.&nbsp; Gincy surveyed the tired face in
the glass as she brushed her hair and resolutely choked back the
homesick hunger which the free life of the mountains had
fostered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might jest as well walk down that way and see if
things air all right.&rdquo;&nbsp; How loud her steps sounded on
the bare corridor floor.&nbsp; Gincy paused before trying the
door of Number 16.&nbsp; She did hope that Lalla and Kizzie had
left it locked.&nbsp; But no, here was the key, and on the
outside, too.&nbsp; &ldquo;I call thet plumb
shiftlessness,&rdquo; she told herself disgustedly.&nbsp; The
girls certainly needed a lesson.&nbsp; Gincy stuck her head in,
carefully surveyed the <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>room, and then locked the door,
slipping the key into her pocket.&nbsp; Let them go to Miss
Howard when they wanted to get in.&nbsp; She came back to her own
room and sat down by the window.&nbsp; In a few minutes the
evening song, in one harmonious chorus, was wafted to her ears,
then snatches of it floated up the stairs as the girls returned
to their rooms.&nbsp; Some one tapped lightly, then turned the
knob, and peered in.&nbsp; It was Mallie Green, and Gincy fancied
she looked surprised to see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy!&nbsp; I was passing and I
thought&mdash;I&rsquo;d see&mdash;why&mdash;you wan&rsquo;t at
dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mallie blurted it out in her usual explosive
fashion, her gaze shifting evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel to want any; my ear aches,&rdquo;
answered Gincy with a sudden accession of coolness toward the
small, shrinking figure.&nbsp; She had been a target for Nancy
Ping&rsquo;s ready wit many a time, but to-day Mallie seemed far
less likable.&nbsp; Every minute her suspicions grew
stronger.&nbsp; Why was Mallie poking into people&rsquo;s rooms
and pretending&mdash;Gincy felt it to be mere pretending&mdash;to
be friends?&nbsp; It was more than mere prankishness to put wet
towels on a pile of freshly-ironed clothes, it was malicious,
especially as the girls were all trying to economize as much as
possible.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Gincy presented the key of Number 16 to
Miss Howard.&nbsp; &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t asked for the master
key,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;so they must be downstairs in
the <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>parlour.&nbsp; Sometimes they don&rsquo;t come up until
the study bell rings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back and see if there is any one hanging
around the door,&rdquo; suggested Gincy.</p>
<p>To their astonishment they found Lalla and Kizzie entertaining
callers.&nbsp; Gincy stood for a moment dumfounded, then dragged
Miss Howard to a quiet corner of the hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;some one left that key in the
door.&nbsp; They heard me coming and didn&rsquo;t have time to
get it out.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll keep hit, then I&rsquo;d like to
see them get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think it&rsquo;s Mallie?&rdquo; asked
Miss Howard soberly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any reason
for her doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, only the Greens and Ponders never did get on
back yonder, and Lalla&rsquo;s always ahead of
Mallie&mdash;she&rsquo;s a year younger, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Howard stopped suddenly, she had started back to her
room.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, Gincy, it wasn&rsquo;t Mallie; she went
into the dining-room ahead of me this evening and gave out a
notice for the basket ball team.&nbsp; I remember now.&nbsp;
Besides, she and Nancy Jane both wipe dishes and are never
upstairs until a half-hour after meal time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For almost a week after that the upper corridors were
peaceful.&nbsp; No one but Gincy doubted that they would remain
so.&nbsp; Saturday evening, when Miss Howard was making her tour
of inspection, she met Lalla and Kizzie going to choir
practice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look into your <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>room just the
same, girls,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
how good it seems, though, to get over dreading it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kizzie sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have stood it
another day.&nbsp; It was getting positively ghost-y, having such
things goin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Howard sighed too as she fitted the master key into the
door of Number 16.&nbsp; Had she a real traitor in the house, or
was it some prankish girl who had gone too far and was now
thoroughly frightened?&nbsp; The room was in perfect order.&nbsp;
How well the two had learned their lesson of neatness.&nbsp; It
rested the tired little teacher just to look at the clean floor,
the fresh curtains, and orderly books.&nbsp; She went over to the
window and looked out.&nbsp; Beyond the roof of the new
dining-room was a long, regular pile of wood, then the tennis
court framed by huge oaks, and still beyond, the mountains.</p>
<p>Miss Howard stood lost in thought for a moment.&nbsp; Each day
brought its problems.&nbsp; She was roused by a light footstep,
there was a quick click of the lock, and the master key was
pulled out from the other side.&nbsp; She was surely a
prisoner.&nbsp; Thoroughly impatient at her own stupidity, Miss
Howard tried the window.&nbsp; She could only pull it down a few
inches from the top.&nbsp; This was the cleverest, most daring
piece of lawlessness which had ever occurred in the Hall.&nbsp;
With the master key gone all kinds of vandalism were possible <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>in that room
and every other.&nbsp; She dropped into a chair irresolute.</p>
<p>A party of seniors had the east parlour until 7:30, which
almost emptied the corridor.&nbsp; One might call incessantly and
not be heard, unless by the wrong girls&mdash;the very ones from
whom she wished to keep the matter a secret.</p>
<p>The chapel bell rang for chorus practice.&nbsp; The outer
world began to grow dusky, still Miss Howard sat perfectly quiet,
apparently reading.&nbsp; She was thinking of a mystery story
which led through a labyrinth of baffling events to a most simple
solution.&nbsp; She grew more and more doubtful of her ability as
a detective.</p>
<p>Presently, two people stopped outside the door for a little
chat.&nbsp; It was Martha Spellman&mdash;on her way to the linen
closet&mdash;and Lalla.&nbsp; Miss Howard waited patiently now
that immediate release was certain, until the door opened.</p>
<p>Lalla&rsquo;s face was the picture of astonishment as she
noticed the occupant of her room.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better
not speak of it, Lalla,&rdquo; cautioned her teacher after
describing the manner of her incarceration.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
girls know enough already; they&rsquo;ll be going home next
thing.&nbsp; No one likes to feel that she&rsquo;s at the mercy
of some lawless person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Miss Howard made an exception of Gincy, who seemed a
link between herself <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>and the mountain people.&nbsp;
Besides Gincy&rsquo;s position as monitor demanded greater
confidence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever it was, knew I was there,&rdquo;
she concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were after the key, they didn&rsquo;t care who was
in there,&rdquo; said Gincy grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hit ain&rsquo;t
likely they&rsquo;ll come again very soon, though, after
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the very next evening Number 16 was again invaded.&nbsp;
This time Lalla&rsquo;s little silver pin was missing, and her
school books hidden in the woodbox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we search Mallie&rsquo;s and Nancy Jane&rsquo;s
room?&rdquo; asked Miss Howard as Lalla stood before her after
making her final complaint.&nbsp; &ldquo;This matter is growing
serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalla hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to
find anything.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re both too smart for that.&nbsp;
We might watch them a spell longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; continued Miss Howard, &ldquo;Mallie
and Nancy Jane are nearly always busy when things happen in your
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalla shook her head as though unconvinced.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
reckon hit&rsquo;s jest one person.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t
sayin&rsquo; who.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lalla,&rdquo; interrogated Gincy shrewdly, &ldquo;who
do you reckon&rsquo;s so plumb foolish as to sneak into your room
whenever you go out for dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you can tell me,&rdquo; answered Lalla with a
flash of temper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; home next
week if hit keeps on.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;Wait a while,&rdquo; encouraged Gincy, ignoring
the insinuation.&nbsp; Personally, she was not fond of Lalla,
whose keen wit never spared any one, but of all the mountain
pupils she was the most talented&mdash;so the teachers had
said&mdash;and Gincy was working for the good of the school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got hit to work out and I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to do hit,&rdquo; she said to herself that
night.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon Lalla&rsquo;s plumb out of patience
or she wouldn&rsquo;t be so touchy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took a firmer grip on the baffling mental problem, her
detective instinct now fully aroused.&nbsp; Things happened at
dinner time.&nbsp; Mallie and Nancy Jane were nearly always at
meals&mdash;and yet&mdash;Gincy thought over every other girl in
the Hall; not one seemed to have either the disposition or the
ability to carry on, undetected, such a warfare.</p>
<p>At six o&rsquo;clock that evening, she was behind the door of
Number 16, the new master key showing temptingly in the
lock.&nbsp; She had figured it all out; the room must be watched
from the inside.&nbsp; This time both window and door were to be
reckoned with.&nbsp; She raised the former to further her scheme,
and told no one except Miss Howard, who promised to bring
Gincy&rsquo;s dinner to her own room that she might eat it
later.</p>
<p>It was a weary vigil, but Gincy worked out some problems and
waited patiently.&nbsp; The hour was almost gone when a slight
tap came <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>at the door.&nbsp; She crowded behind a dress in the
corner and listened eagerly.&nbsp; The door swung slightly and
Nancy Jane Ping looked in.&nbsp; Her small, inquisitive eyes
seemed to pierce every corner, and Gincy had a breathless moment
of expectancy.&nbsp; Kizzie&rsquo;s yellow muslin was a feeble
barrier for the gimlet glances to penetrate.</p>
<p>For a moment, the intruder stood keenly surveying the room,
then withdrew and walked slowly down the hall.&nbsp; Gincy
waited, but she did not return.&nbsp; After all, the evidence was
very incomplete.&nbsp; Anybody might have looked into a room
whose door was slightly ajar.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t matter how
much inward conviction one had if she lacked tangible
proof.&nbsp; The whole baffling pursuit had to be begun again,
and Gincy united her Scotch persistency and Irish wit afresh.</p>
<p>For a week she was absent from the dining-room at the dinner
hour, the most sociable time of the day.&nbsp; It had not been
necessary to tell Kizzie or Lalla, or, in fact, anybody, as she
sat in the Annex dining-room, and they rarely saw each other.</p>
<p>Still nothing happened, and Gincy went on studying her
arithmetic and planning her work for rhetoricals.&nbsp; She did
not forget to keep the window open, however, and the shining new
master key in the door as a bait.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever hit is
won&rsquo;t resk coming in at the <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>window, they&rsquo;d be suspicioned
sure if any one should open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reasoned it all out as she sat motionless on the fifth
night of her vigil.&nbsp; Almost at that moment the event which
she had been anticipating happened.&nbsp; The key clicked in the
lock and she was shut in.&nbsp; For one instant she listened to
hear in which direction the retreating footsteps were
going&mdash;there was a telltale squeak which betrayed
it&mdash;then Gincy bounded across the room and slipped out of
the window.&nbsp; She ran noiselessly to where the halls crossed
and a door led to a back stair landing.&nbsp; Gincy knew that she
could see from there any one who came down the main hall, while
the dark corner was a safe hiding-place for herself.</p>
<p>She had barely gained the desired spot, when some one vaulted
past and out upon the roof.&nbsp; It was Lalla Ponder who stole
cautiously along and deposited a small, shining object in a
convenient niche near the cornice.&nbsp; Gincy could hardly
believe her eyes, but when Lalla turned her back, she looked into
the main hall and saw that it was entirely empty.&nbsp; She knew
that Lalla would not attempt to gain her room by the window, but
would come back into the hall and either go down the back stairs
or come up boldly and unlock her door.&nbsp; Gincy pounded on a
nearby door vigorously, knowing that its occupant was probably
taking care of the lamps in the <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>lower hall, then she walked noisily
to meet Lalla, who had regained the hall when her back was
turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I borrow your dictionary?&rdquo; she asked in the
grip of a sudden courage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary must be out; she
doesn&rsquo;t answer when I knock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you may,&rdquo; Lalla answered, but Gincy
noticed how her hand trembled as she unlocked the door with her
own key which hung on a narrow plaid ribbon at her belt.&nbsp;
She hesitated before stepping in, and gave a little start of
surprise when she saw an empty room.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
losing my nerve, I reckon, with all the queer doin&rsquo;s
&rsquo;round here lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy&rsquo;s face hardened.&nbsp; Could Lalla be crazy?&nbsp;
She watched the girl narrowly as she searched the closet, peered
behind the door with every sign of anxiety, and gave a sigh of
relief when she found nothing out of order.</p>
<p>Once in possession of the dictionary, Gincy hurried to Miss
Howard with her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been dreaming, child?&rdquo; the latter asked
in astonishment.&nbsp; But Gincy shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been studyin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout hit since I
found her out.&nbsp; Hit&rsquo;s that feud business and
she&rsquo;s trying to fasten hit onto Mallie.&nbsp; The girls
will believe hit too, Mallie&rsquo;s so ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Howard from her own conviction felt that they
would.&nbsp; She followed Gincy to the end of the hall; they
slipped out upon the roof and found both keys securely hidden <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>from any
casual observer just where Lalla had concealed them five minutes
before.&nbsp; Silently the two filed back to Miss Howard&rsquo;s
room.&nbsp; Gincy felt the little teacher&rsquo;s inward struggle
to readjust her point of view.&nbsp; Mallie was not a favourite,
while Lalla had quite a following and was counted unusually
bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; Gincy explained to the
bewildered teacher.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Greens and Ponders have
warred hit for years back there in the hills, and they aim never
to forget hit.&nbsp; Most of the young folks see how foolish hit
is, but they&rsquo;re a sorry lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Howard sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must have time to think it
over.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m rather upset this evening, Gincy.&nbsp;
Thank you for helping me.&nbsp; Please don&rsquo;t say anything
about it until I see you again.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t see why Lalla
should want to injure her own clothes to get Mallie sent home,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Gincy had left, Miss Howard sat for a long time, her
hands toying idly with the two keys.&nbsp; If the dean knew of
the trouble, Lalla would be suspended at once as she richly
deserved.&nbsp; She would go back to the poorest of mountain
homes and the bright, keen mind, undirected and bent on mischief,
would soon bring the girl to grief.</p>
<p>The next day, at her first opportunity, she called Gincy into
her room.&nbsp; Carefully she approached the subject.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What kind of a home did you say Lalla had,
Gincy?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;Mighty pore,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the illest kind of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Howard pondered a moment over the next question.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you suppose will become of her when she gets back
in the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy shook her head gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose it will be worth while for us
to try reforming her?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Miss Howard explained the
probation plan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only you and I know that she is the
mischief maker.&nbsp; If nothing more happens the pupils will
soon forget it.&nbsp; Of course everything depends on how she
acts.&nbsp; She must contradict the report about Mallie and
promise better behaviour in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy&rsquo;s face showed an inward struggle; this was so
unlike the code of the mountains.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I
couldn&rsquo;t trust her,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m willing to do anything you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a long talk with her this
afternoon,&rdquo; Miss Howard continued, &ldquo;and find out the
reason for her conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a light tap at the door, then it was pushed open and
Lalla walked in.&nbsp; Her eyes had a sleepless look, her face
was colourless.&nbsp; Instantly the two knew her errand.&nbsp;
She talked very rapidly, as if fearful of losing her
courage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I started at first to fool Kizzie&mdash;she
said no one could do it&mdash;then I remembered something pretty
mean Mallie did to me back home and it seemed like my time had
come <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>to
get even.&nbsp; When you wanted to search her room I got to
studying about it.&nbsp; I was taking away her chance for
learning, and she needing it mighty bad&mdash;as bad as any one
could.&nbsp; I was letting you think her a
thief&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Lalla broke down completely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ll have&mdash;to&mdash;send me
h&mdash;ome, I&rsquo;m plumb bad, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy waited for no more.&nbsp; She flung her arms around the
weeping girl with sudden tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you were brave enough to confess your
wrongdoing, Lalla,&rdquo; said Miss Howard, much relieved.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think you deserve another chance, and Gincy and I are
going to see that you have it, too.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t propose
to tell anybody about this, so you&rsquo;ll have nothing to live
down.&nbsp; Just show us a clean record from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo; and here the
magnitude of Miss Howard&rsquo;s generosity seemed to transform
Lalla&rsquo;s whole being.&nbsp; She stood up tall and straight
before the two.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be sorry for
trusting me,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I reckon if you
can forgive me for worrying you so, I ought to forgive Mallie and
help her to be a better girl, too.&rdquo;</p>

THE BAPTIZING</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Gincy</span> worked hard every day.&nbsp;
Each night she went to bed weary in mind and body, but the
morning found her anxious to begin again.&nbsp; Saturday
afternoon was free for long walking trips to Cowbell Hollow, Blue
Lick, or the nearby peaks.&nbsp; Already an early frost had
touched the tulip trees with spots of gold, the sumac showed a
fiery rim, and Nature was doing her best to woo attention.&nbsp;
Gincy and Urilla did not need the lure, their hearts were longing
for the hills.</p>
<p>Miss Howard must have read their thoughts.&nbsp; Early
Saturday morning she tapped at their door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Girls,
wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go out to the bungalow on Indian
Mountain this afternoon?&nbsp; The college team will take us and
we can come back by moonlight to-morrow evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we would!&rdquo; both girls exclaimed.&nbsp;
Then Gincy hugged the little teacher until she laughingly slipped
away, admonishing them to be ready soon after lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the room straightened out in a
jiffy,&rdquo; said Urilla before the door had fairly <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>closed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad we&rsquo;re going, honey, it&rsquo;ll
make you over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy had never seen her calm room-mate quite so
enthusiastic&mdash;her cheeks were flushed with excitement and
she rushed around dusting the furniture with a vigorous
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better clear out right away,&rdquo;
she laughed, &ldquo;and see if there&rsquo;s any mail.&nbsp;
There won&rsquo;t be enough left of me to go if you keep on the
way you&rsquo;ve started; you suck up the dust like a
cyclone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a letter from Talitha,&rdquo; Urilla called
after her.</p>
<p>It was four miles to Indian Mountain, the last two a steady
climb&mdash;steep in places and sidling&mdash;but the five did
not mind it.&nbsp; Zack and Zeke, the two fat mules belonging to
the college farm, took a steady jog-trot until they reached the
foot, and then slowed down for the long, hard pull.&nbsp; Lalla
Ponder was poised recklessly near a mound of provisions guarded
by some extra quilts.&nbsp; Her light curls and nimble tongue
were in constant motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like tippy places and caves,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one back in Clay that&rsquo;s haunted, they
say, but I&rsquo;ve been in it and never cared a rap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re never afraid of anything,&rdquo; remarked
Kizzie, looking up at her room-mate admiringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know where you haven&rsquo;t been that&rsquo;s
crawl-y and creep-y.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s one place on this mountain.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve never been all the way through Fat Man&rsquo;s
Misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all try hit,&rdquo; Gincy proposed
recklessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If hit can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys often do it, but it&rsquo;s a pretty hard
climb for you girls,&rdquo; said Miss Howard who sat with the
driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to build a fire in the fireplace and
pop some corn,&rdquo; Urilla suddenly remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Gincy will help me sweep the bungalow before
she goes exploring,&rdquo; ventured Miss Howard with a
twinkle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I will,&rdquo; assented Gincy, catching the
look of mischief.&nbsp; &ldquo;You-all no &rsquo;count folks kin
go on and have your fun; you&rsquo;ll be back comin&rsquo; meal
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wagon suddenly lurched, checking the chorus of
protests.&nbsp; Lalla lost her balance, falling on Urilla.&nbsp;
The basket of fruit and vegetables overturned and the driver
halted for repairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s only a rock that big
storm onsettled t&rsquo;other night.&nbsp; Them ornery mules jest
nachelly struck hit,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Back and forth the road wound, continually disclosing new
vistas.&nbsp; In the coves farmers were gathering the
&ldquo;crap.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were pine-capped crests, bare,
tumbled rocks, stream beds showing traces of tempestuous high
water, threaded now by tiny, twinkling rills.&nbsp; Beyond, and
still beyond, reared peak after peak of the Cumberlands.&nbsp;
Gincy looked eagerly toward the southeast.&nbsp; For a moment she
almost imagined she could see the tiny cabin perched above Goose
Creek.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>After
a hard climb of almost two hours, the level space on the
mountain-top was reached.&nbsp; From a thicket of young trees
they emerged into a cleared space where stood a long, red
bungalow apparently without doors or windows.&nbsp; Built at the
edge of a cliff, it commanded a wonderful view of the surrounding
mountains and the Blue Grass country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re here at last!&rdquo; Gincy
tumbled out hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whar do you git in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down the chimney, of course,&rdquo; laughed
Urilla.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look for the ladder under the
bungalow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might watch and see how I do it,&rdquo; said Miss
Howard, producing a key and going around to the rear of the
building.&nbsp; Presently she pushed up sections of the
side&mdash;one by one&mdash;and lastly threw back the wide front
doors.</p>
<p>Gincy stood for a moment enraptured.&nbsp; Below for miles was
a fair, level country dotted with towns&mdash;another world of
which she knew nothing.&nbsp; The sun was dipping westward toward
a bluish-purple horizon.</p>
<p>By five o&rsquo;clock everything was in order.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not a lazy bone among you,&rdquo; Miss Howard assured
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now scatter and have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They needed no second bidding.&nbsp; Lalla led off at a
break-neck speed.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start in at the cave
and come back by Fat Man&rsquo;s Misery; it&rsquo;ll land us
right in front of the bungalow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urilla groaned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sh-h-h,&rdquo; warned Kizzie, <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to initiate Gincy; none of us
are fat enough to get stuck, so you needn&rsquo;t
worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worrying,&rdquo; answered Urilla
reproachfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired after all my work
this morning, but I&rsquo;m not going to back out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The path to the cave led through a grove of young oaks.&nbsp;
There were tall ferns and rhododendrons, and mountain
laurel.&nbsp; Lalla paused at an immense fallen tree which seemed
to block the way; its great roots hung over the yawning space
below.&nbsp; Nimbly she sprang upon the giant trunk and
disappeared on the other side, calling for the rest to
follow.</p>
<p>When the three had done so, they caught a vanishing glimpse of
Lalla descending hand over hand on the strong branch of a mammoth
grapevine.&nbsp; Thirty feet below she landed upon the level
surface of a mossy boulder.&nbsp; Gincy followed Kizzie, and
Urilla came last.&nbsp; Before them was the large opening of the
cave&mdash;a favourite haunt of the students, who from time to
time occupied the college bungalow.&nbsp; At its rear, a long,
wide crack in the solid rock led in a zigzag direction for twenty
rods or more.&nbsp; The path was extremely narrow, and sloping at
a sharp incline.&nbsp; Kizzie dodged ahead and Gincy was close
behind.&nbsp; Each moment the former grew more reckless; she
gathered her skirts around her and slid down a swift descent, the
others following.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! but it&rsquo;s dampish!&rdquo; said Gincy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hear that water?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>A
steady drip, drip, drip came from the walls.&nbsp; In the cracks
were long fronded ferns, moss, and here and there wild
geraniums.&nbsp; A cool draught struck them.&nbsp; At the farther
end the rocks seemed almost to touch, and only a tiny thread of
light showed from above.&nbsp; Gincy was close to Kizzie when
they reached the narrowest part and began the long, tortuous
climb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be ready for hot coffee by the time we get
to the top,&rdquo; called Urilla from the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Miss Howard won&rsquo;t fuss; I kin eat
anythin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m so hungry,&rdquo; said Gincy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she won&rsquo;t fuss,&rdquo; panted
Kizzie.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a born manager; she&rsquo;ll
have everything on the table in great shape and a picture painted
to boot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up, up, with a scanty, stony foothold, Gincy followed close
behind Kizzie, her face growing redder, her breath shorter.&nbsp;
The crack of blue was broadening, roots and stocky ferns afforded
a surer grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost there!&rdquo; Kizzie exulted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What on earth are you doing with that stick,
Gincy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch me and see!&rdquo;&nbsp; Dexterously Gincy
inserted the short, stout stick crosswise above her head and
swung up a long step to safe footing beside her leader.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re up, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; she said,
astonished as her eyes caught a glimpse of the foundation of the
bungalow a few yards away.&nbsp; The four pulled <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>themselves
up the few remaining feet and dropped down in a weary, silent row
on a big, flat stone which commanded a glorious view.&nbsp; Even
Lalla&rsquo;s twinkling eyes had lost their usual expression of
mischief, and she sat soberly viewing the scene before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Kizzie,&rdquo; exclaimed Urilla, pointing back to
the open bungalow, &ldquo;Miss Howard&rsquo;s been to the spring
for water, the table&rsquo;s all set, and I can smell the
chicken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy Jane was up at sunrise the next morning.&nbsp; She and
Mallie stole out of bed noiselessly and started for the
spring&mdash;it was their turn to get water.&nbsp; There had been
a heavy dew, but neither girl wore rubbers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Another
fine day,&rdquo; said Mallie, stepping high.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
look at the hills!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re the highest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The winding footpath near the cliff&rsquo;s edge gave a
magnificent view of the peaks which formed a huge semicircle
around Indian Mountain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost like to
live up here,&rdquo; said Nancy Jane.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
more sightly than back in the hills and so near
Bentville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two stood near the sagging gate of a yard which had been
swept clean as a floor.&nbsp; A few long-legged chickens stepped
about gingerly.&nbsp; On the very edge of the cliff stood a low
frame house, and near it a corn crib set high to keep out the
rats.&nbsp; The path to the spring led through the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Haggis family live here,&rdquo; announced Mallie as
she held the gate open.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Howard told
me about them last night&mdash;they&rsquo;re awfully
poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small, fat boy wearing a single loose garment was busily
playing in the rain barrel.&nbsp; He had a gourd with which he
dipped the water out into a pail, sprinkling himself plentifully
meanwhile.&nbsp; In the house breakfast was over, and Mrs. Haggis
walked around heavily as though her night&rsquo;s sleep had
failed to rest her.&nbsp; She looked old from sickness and
overwork; but the girls knew that look&mdash;nearly all the
mountain women had it&mdash;and judged her to be about
forty-five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; she said, beaming at them as they
approached the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud ter see
ye.&nbsp; I was a-feelin&rsquo; jest as down-sperited an&rsquo;
lonesome when ye druv up yistiddy, an&rsquo; all of a suddint the
chickens begun ter crow like they knew you&rsquo;d come.&nbsp;
How&rsquo;s Miss Howard?&nbsp; I think a heap o&rsquo;
seein&rsquo; her every year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; smiled Nancy Jane, &ldquo;and
coming over to see you to-day.&nbsp; We were all pretty tired
last night and went to bed early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope our cow didn&rsquo;t keep ye awake; Job found
her thar come light this mornin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I reckon
she&rsquo;s proud you&rsquo;ve come&mdash;like we-uns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls laughed merrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Urilla drove her off
in the night.&nbsp; She was browsing around the bushes ringing
her bell like a fire alarm; it was too funny!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mallie
ended the recital with such evident enjoyment of the situation
that Mrs. Haggis joined in the laugh.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; two weeks sence a soul
war on this mounting,&rdquo; sighed the woman, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m too porely ter travel any.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you never
feel like you&rsquo;d jest got ter talk to some one &rsquo;sides
your own folks?&nbsp; When I&rsquo;m shet of the men folks fer
the day an&rsquo; can&rsquo;t even see &rsquo;em workin&rsquo; in
the cove or hear old Barb&rsquo;s bell, thar ain&rsquo;t a human
ter talk to &rsquo;cept Elam, onless my Rodie comes up from the
Hollow an&rsquo; packs her baby up these yere rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Haggis was walking along with them toward the spring,
talking eagerly.&nbsp; Little Elam had grabbed Nancy Jane&rsquo;s
proffered finger and was trotting by her side; with his other
hand he held his dress up as he had seen his mother do.&nbsp;
Both the girls noticed how clean the faded blue calico was, and
that the back yard was swept as carefully as the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Haggis,&rdquo; said Mallie, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t look strong enough to do so much work; you&rsquo;re
wearing yourself out cleaning like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Pears like when I
don&rsquo;t work, I git ter studyin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout the
chil&rsquo;ren&mdash;I&rsquo;ve buried seven of &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s when we lived over in the fur aidge o&rsquo; Jackson
County.&nbsp; Thar&rsquo;s only three left &rsquo;sides Elam; two
are up in Indiany&mdash;married&mdash;an&rsquo; Rodie&rsquo;s man
works the college farm below here.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see her
none too often; she helps tend the crap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bushes and saplings hedged their path for several rods,
then they came to a tumble <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>of rocks on the very edge of the
cliff.&nbsp; A skeleton pine whose roots still clung in the
crevices, between the rocks, stood out bare and white.&nbsp; At
its base was a windlass, and to the bare trunk were attached
wires which slanted down into the treetops below.&nbsp; Mrs.
Haggis fastened the pail the girls had brought to the upper
wire&mdash;a block of wood and a pulley kept it upright&mdash;and
started it on its way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My,&rdquo; exclaimed Mallie, looking down at the tops
of the tulip trees, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a long way to go for
water.&nbsp; Is there a spring at the bottom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, nigh fourteen hundred feet down,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Haggis.&nbsp; &ldquo;You-all hang onto Elam, he&rsquo;s crazy ter
look over the aidge o&rsquo; things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us do it,&rdquo; protested Nancy Jane, alternately
watching the slender, bent figure and the pail bobbing down the
wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;, doin&rsquo; this;
hit&rsquo;s the washin&rsquo; wears me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you, have to pull it all up from
down there and then carry it to the house?&rdquo; Mallie inquired
in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t ketch when hit rains.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;d ye think I got hit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Mallie soberly,
tugging at Elam.&nbsp; &ldquo;You say your daughter comes up this
way.&nbsp; I wonder if we couldn&rsquo;t find the path and go to
her house some time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In course ye could.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d appreciate a
visit from you-all the best kind.&nbsp; <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>Hit&rsquo;s
middlin&rsquo; steep, though, an&rsquo; a power o&rsquo; work
climbin&rsquo; back, but I reckon ye wouldn&rsquo;t
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy Jane insisted on bringing up the water; it was quite an
effort for even her strong, young arms.&nbsp; Then they hurried
back to the bungalow to find Gincy frying bacon and the rest
making beds.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d be coming along
pretty soon,&rdquo; she said, dropping the eggs into the
skillet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Howard wants to ask you
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to visit Miss Clark&rsquo;s school
to-day, it&rsquo;s only a little piece from the foot of the
mountain near the pinnacle?&nbsp; We can walk it in an hour and a
half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s Sunday!&rdquo; exclaimed Mallie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How could we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urilla laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Sunday a good day to
go to Sunday-school, honey?&nbsp; You must be dreaming.&nbsp;
Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; I never thought of a
Sunday-school out here; of course I&rsquo;ll go.&nbsp; When do we
start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as the dishes are done.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
put up our dinners and walk back just before sunset.&nbsp; We
must allow two hours for the climb, anyhow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss
Howard began planning for the luncheon.</p>
<p>By eight o&rsquo;clock the little party were on their
way.&nbsp; Mrs. Haggis came out to the gate as they went
by.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I war goin&rsquo;, too,&rdquo; she said
wistfully, &ldquo;but pore folks has ter work.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t tromp &rsquo;round the mountings <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>an&rsquo;
git my meals.&nbsp; You-all go on an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll wash some
dishes; I couldn&rsquo;t run &rsquo;round nohow an&rsquo; let Job
do hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visitors waved a good-bye and started on.&nbsp; A mountain
bluebird darted hither and yon, a cardinal shot like a bright
gleam through the gay foliage.&nbsp; The dew was still heavy in
the shady places, but they followed the deep wagon track caused
by heavy loads of picnickers from the college, and parties at the
bungalow.&nbsp; The season was almost over for these, and then
the long winter&rsquo;s isolation began for the Haggis
family&mdash;an isolation shared by thousands over this great
mountain region.</p>
<p>Every downward turn revealed a glimpse of beauty which the
girls had not noticed going up.&nbsp; From the coves where the
men had been ploughing for fall crops came a fragrant, earthy
odour.&nbsp; Off to the southeast range after range rose blue
against the sky.&nbsp; At last they reached the pike which led
past the little settlement at the foot of the pinnacle.&nbsp; A
number of people passed them on horseback with the usual
greeting; otherwise the stillness was Sabbath-like.</p>
<p>A turn in the road disclosed the church house, a neat log
building near a little spring, and overshadowed by a
turreted-topped mountain.&nbsp; There were other buildings in the
same yard, and probably a dozen scattered around in sight.&nbsp;
The girls noticed that they were <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>of a better type than those back in
the hills at Goose Creek, for only one was windowless.</p>
<p>Two vehicles were approaching.&nbsp; The driver of the first
was a tall, pleasant-faced, youngish-looking woman who nodded at
them with a smile of surprised recognition as she checked the
sleek chestnut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, good-morning, Miss Howard!&nbsp; Had you started
for my place?&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not going to have any
Sunday-school to-day&mdash;there&rsquo;s to be a baptizing in the
afternoon&mdash;and I promised to attend services at Bentville
this morning.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the only chance I&rsquo;ve had for
a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have you miss it for anything, Miss
Clark; go right on, all we want is permission to eat our lunch in
your yard,&rdquo; said Miss Howard, smiling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like to stay to the baptizing, wouldn&rsquo;t
you, girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an enthusiastic affirmative from every one.&nbsp;
Nobody in the mountains ever missed a baptizing if it were
possible to get there.</p>
<p>Miss Clark leaned forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go right into the
dog-trot at my house; my raincoat is hanging on the
right&mdash;near my bedroom door; under it you will find the
key.&nbsp; Make yourself perfectly at home until I come
back.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better make some coffee on the oil stove;
there&rsquo;s cream in the spring house.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come
back early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you ever so much, but don&rsquo;t hurry <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>back!&rdquo; urged Miss Howard.&nbsp; &ldquo;You need
the change, and we&rsquo;ll get along splendidly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad we came!&rdquo; exclaimed
Urilla.&nbsp; &ldquo;A baptizin&rsquo; is lots more interesting
than a Sunday-school.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s Miss Clark; I never
saw her before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Kizzie, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure I
shall like her.&nbsp; They say she&rsquo;s helped a good many
girls to go to Bentville after they&rsquo;ve finished out
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And boys, too,&rdquo; added Miss Howard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s changed the whole neighbourhood.&nbsp; If you
could only hear her tell of some of her thrilling experiences
during the last twelve years&mdash;of the shootings, and
brawlings, and fightings.&nbsp; To-day the people go to her for
everything.&nbsp; She teaches them to sew, and cook, shows them
how to care for the sick and the babies.&nbsp; Oh, Miss Clark is
a wonderful woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be,&rdquo; said Gincy soberly, thinking of
Goose Creek and its needs.&nbsp; The second team was passing them
and she looked up quickly as a familiar voice called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, what are you-all doing out this
way?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was Joe Bradshaw and his roommate, Raphael
Sloan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raf lives out here at Pigg Branch and I&rsquo;ve been
visiting him.&nbsp; We thought you were up at the bungalow and
we&rsquo;d drive up for two or three hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&ldquo;Awfully sorry,&rdquo; said Lalla, &ldquo;we
brought our dinners, and&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she looked at
Miss Howard.&nbsp; That lady smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come back with us&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
have plenty for two more&mdash;then we can all see the baptizing
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys needed no second invitation.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were
coming down for that anyhow,&rdquo; said Raphael, as they turned
around.</p>
<p>Miss Clark&rsquo;s home was close to the church house.&nbsp;
It was a log house, built Virginia style, with a wide, covered
porch through the centre separating the two sides.&nbsp; This
dog-trot was a cool place in warm weather, a place to churn, and
wash, a place to visit, and sew, or even take a nap.&nbsp; Mallie
sank down upon the old-fashioned couch and looked off toward the
cabins across the road.&nbsp; They were scattered up the branch,
and on beyond, one perched high in a patch of ploughed ground on
the opposite mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a lovely place!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
glancing back at the trellised nasturtiums and morning-glories
against the kitchen windows.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think Miss Clark is
great!&nbsp; Look at those ducks in the branch, and such a lot of
chickens.&nbsp; How can she find time for everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s great!&rdquo;&nbsp; Raphael Sloan
sank down on the floor cross-legged.&nbsp; &ldquo;She can do
everything&mdash;play the organ, preach a sermon, knock a bench
together better than the boys, and ride any horse around
here.&nbsp; She <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>rode the most ornery mule in these parts one
night.&nbsp; Ever hear about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a chorus of negatives, and Raphael&rsquo;s dark eyes
lighted over the prospect of thrilling the company.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was about five years ago when the Bennett and MacGowan
feud was stirring things up &rsquo;round here and everybody
seemed bound to take sides.&nbsp; Miss Clark tried to keep out of
it, for there were children from both families in school.&nbsp;
One morning Hugh MacGowan came over to borrow a big needle to sew
up his mule&rsquo;s shoulder&mdash;some one had cut a long gash
in it the night before.&nbsp; You just ought to have seen her
eyes flash&mdash;I went to school to her then&mdash;and she
everlastingly told us what she thought of a man or boy who would
hurt an animal because he hated the owner.&nbsp; Of course the
Bennett children went home and told it, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they all liked her,&rdquo; interrupted
Gincy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did, but the old folks didn&rsquo;t relish being
criticised even though no names were used.&nbsp; Miss Clark found
a note pinned to her door the next morning telling her to mind
her own business or she&rsquo;d get into trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things were quiet for a while, then one time about
midnight, she heard some drunken men going by shouting and
singing&mdash;then four or five shots.&nbsp; It was bright
moonlight and Miss Clark could see that one was wounded and
swaying on his mule; the rest galloped <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>off.&nbsp;
Izzie Gray was staying with her then, and begged her not to stir
outside, but do you suppose she&rsquo;d do anything of the
kind?&nbsp; Not much.&nbsp; She sailed out and found Lem Bennett
bleeding to death&mdash;his arm all shot up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raphael stopped suddenly with dramatic effect.&nbsp; His
audience was plainly excited and expectant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on,
Raf!&rdquo; commanded Joe impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Clark rode that mule clear into Bentville
and got a doctor, or the Bennett youngsters wouldn&rsquo;t have a
father to-day, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it stop the fighting?&rdquo; asked Gincy, jumping
up suddenly.&nbsp; She fished the key from under the long
raincoat and fitted it into the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I really think it did.&nbsp; She told Lem
Bennett&mdash;he was the worst of the crowd&mdash;that she saved
his life so he could have a chance to be a better man, and that
she loved his children and wanted them to have a better
father.&nbsp; Then she had a long talk with the MacGowans.&nbsp;
After that the county went dry&mdash;she had a hand in that,
too&mdash;and there wasn&rsquo;t any more trouble.&nbsp; Oh, Miss
Clark is fine, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think she was,&rdquo; said Nancy Jane, her
eyes open wide with admiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s
go in and see how she lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy was already inside.&nbsp; The rest followed.&nbsp; There
was a large bookcase filled with <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>books and magazines, a piano, a big
fireplace with a comfortable seat and chair near it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Clark made that seat,&rdquo; said Raphael.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We boys made the chair, and the piano was sent her by some
rich people up north.&nbsp; We helped her paint and varnish the
floors, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has some new rugs,&rdquo; said Miss Howard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re like those made down at the loom
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were three made of rags with patterns in the
borders.&nbsp; They were blue and white.&nbsp; The curtains were
white cheesecloth with a blue, stencilled pattern across the
bottom.&nbsp; A few water colours and Hoffman&rsquo;s Christ were
the only pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on back and help me find the oil stove; I&rsquo;m
getting hungry,&rdquo; called Kizzie from the dining-room.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this cosy?&rdquo; she asked, pointing to the
long, built-in cupboard and the little square table in the centre
of the room.</p>
<p>Beyond, was the kitchen.&nbsp; A large range occupied one
corner near the sink.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made candy and
popped corn here many a time,&rdquo; said Raphael.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Miss Clark has a cooking class every week this year for
the older people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The oil stove was soon discovered and the coffee over.&nbsp;
They ate their dinner in the dogtrot and the crumbs went to the
chickens who were sociably inclined.&nbsp; Then they started for
the church house, going through the garden and a long arbour.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&ldquo;What lovely flowers!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mallie stopped
to admire the larkspurs and fall roses until the rest had
disappeared inside the church, then she followed.</p>
<p>It was a T-shaped building, one upright being used for the day
school and the other for the Sunday-school and monthly
preaching.&nbsp; In case of a crowd the two rooms could be thrown
into one.&nbsp; A tiny, portable organ occupied the space near
the pulpit.&nbsp; Various mottoes, picture cards, and Bible
charts adorned the walls.&nbsp; There were a large fireplace and
a small sheet-iron stove, a dozen long benches which could be
stacked at one side when they met for sociability, and a little
Sunday-school library sitting in neat uprightness on the open
shelves.</p>
<p>Miss Howard played a half-dozen hymns and they all sang, then
Gincy, in a clear, sweet voice, read the lesson.&nbsp; Miss
Howard was explaining it when the people began to gather for the
baptizing.&nbsp; They came on horseback, in jolt wagons, and
afoot.&nbsp; Not far from the house the branch widened until in
spring it was almost a pond.&nbsp; Here, under the shade of a
dozen walnut and tulip trees, a motley crowd was assembling and
the folks inside the church house hurried out to join them.&nbsp;
Once outside, they saw Miss Clark coming up the pike, her horse
trotting briskly.</p>
<p>They waited at the gate.&nbsp; It wanted only a few minutes of
the time and the horse must <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>be unharnessed.&nbsp; Joe dropped
the bars and Rafael helped Miss Clark out of the carriage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You go on with the rest,&rdquo; he said in a low tone,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be along after a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they went down the little slope, its edge crowded
with women and children.&nbsp; One lone cottonwood shadowed the
pool in its deepest place, stretching mottled arms almost to the
opposite bank.&nbsp; Half its roots were bare and white, washed
by the spring torrents.</p>
<p>Each moment the gathering was augmented by fresh
arrivals.&nbsp; Joe and Raphael came up silently and stood near
Miss Clark.&nbsp; A gaunt mountain preacher whispered a few words
to her, his face showing some perplexity.&nbsp; She turned to the
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raphael, won&rsquo;t you and Joe run up to the
house?&nbsp; In the woodshed you will find a shovel and
hoe.&nbsp; Bring them here as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later the boys came panting back, bearing the
required utensils.&nbsp; Two brawny mountain men took them, waded
out into the shallow water, and began digging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re making it deeper,&rdquo; said Nancy
Jane.&nbsp; &ldquo;My, but won&rsquo;t it be roily!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the men worked the strange audience waited.&nbsp; Near
the water&rsquo;s edge stood the candidates for baptism&mdash;two
girls about seventeen, a woman, and a middle-aged man with wiry
black hair and dark, smouldering eyes.&nbsp; <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>He was
short and stocky, a man of force, and&mdash;if roused&mdash;of
fury.</p>
<p>A long carryall was toiling up the hill.&nbsp; Joe saw it
first.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the college team,&rdquo; he
whispered to Miss Howard.&nbsp; &ldquo;There must be a dozen
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Professor Butler&rsquo;s
going to do the baptizing; the rest came along to
sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already they could hear the strains of &ldquo;Rock of Ages,
Cleft for Me,&rdquo; the rich, full tones swelling through the
quiet autumn air as the people in the carryall approached.&nbsp;
One by one they joined the waiting crowd.&nbsp; The digging had
stopped and there was a hush of expectancy as the minister made
his way toward the waiting candidates.&nbsp; He spoke to them
quietly, then turned until his glance swept the assemblage.</p>
<p>Gincy never forgot that day.&nbsp; The frightened girls in the
foreground, with their coarse, white dresses; the children, their
faces curious and alarmed; the sunbonneted women; the row of men
on the fence in the rear&mdash;sallow, sunburned, and some
bearing the marks of dissipation.&nbsp; But what impressed her
most was the exalted look on the face of the man when he emerged
from the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; she whispered to Raphael Sloan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lem Bennett,&rdquo; he whispered back, &ldquo;and the
woman is his wife.&rdquo;</p>

SI QUINN REVEALS A SECRET</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Only</span> that one forenoon did Talitha
hold school in the hollow.&nbsp; The very next day the weather
took a turn, a cold wind blew up, and for more than a week a
lowering sky gave promise of rain it failed to fulfil-except now
and then in spiteful gusts.&nbsp; Her hopes, to which she had
clung with a brave persistence, vanished with the sunshine.</p>
<p>She was greatly puzzled at the indifference her family
displayed over the loss of the schoolhouse and its
contents.&nbsp; Evidently the school must be discontinued until
another year at least.&nbsp; It was getting too late in the
season to hope for more than a few days&mdash;at a
time&mdash;warm enough to hold the session out of doors.&nbsp;
She had thought some place might be opened to her, but the cabins
were small and already overcrowded.&nbsp; When she suggested that
the children meet at her own home for a few hours each day, her
parents decidedly objected.&nbsp; Even Dan Gooch seemed to forget
his anxiety to have Billy and Sudie &ldquo;git
larnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and, although she had offered to assist <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>them with
their lessons, along with her own brothers, they had not put in
an appearance.</p>
<p>Now that her plans for helping the young people of Goose Creek
had failed, Talitha felt more keenly than ever the disappointment
of returning home.&nbsp; She took all the heaviest work of the
household upon her strong, young shoulders.&nbsp; The spinning
wheel whirred through the long afternoons which otherwise would
have been dull and dreary enough.&nbsp; She had no heart to call
on neighbours or kinfolk; they did not need her.&nbsp; Si Quinn
had also lost all interest in school matters, or she had failed
to meet his expectations.&nbsp; It was strange she had not known
it before, and yet she had done her best.</p>
<p>She had time now to notice the change that had come over her
father.&nbsp; Every morning he went off, his axe over his
shoulder; such fore-handedness in getting the winter&rsquo;s wood
was unusual in him.&nbsp; When Martin was home it was he who saw
that they did not lack for fuel when the cold weather came
on.</p>
<p>At the end of the second week she received a letter from her
brother.&nbsp; It was the first he had ever written her, for they
had never been separated before.&nbsp; Talitha puzzled over its
pages, growing more and more bewildered at their contents:
&ldquo;Si Quinn wrote me about the schoolhouse.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t
it great!&nbsp; Jake always was heady, he could work up that
temper of his until he was worse than a hornet.&nbsp; I hope <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>this&rsquo;ll be a lesson he&rsquo;ll remember.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m just as proud of you as I can be.&nbsp; Everything has
worked out for the best after all, hasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Gincy
is studying like a whale.&nbsp; She was mightily disturbed when
she heard you&rsquo;d gone home on her account and I had all I
could do to keep her from tagging along after you.&nbsp; But
Gincy has a heap of good sense.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s Miss
Howard&rsquo;s right hand man; I don&rsquo;t get a sight of her
except at meal times, but I can hear her voice on the high notes
&rsquo;way above the rest come Harmonia nights.&mdash;Oh,
Gincy&rsquo;s making good, all right, and I&rsquo;m glad as can
be, but I do miss you awfully, sis&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha finished and then her eyes wandered back toward the
beginning.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it one
bit,&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mart doesn&rsquo;t seem to
care at all that the schoolhouse burned.&nbsp; He writes as
though it were almost a joke.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tears rushed to
Talitha&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going right over to
the schoolmaster&rsquo;s, maybe he can explain it,&rdquo; she
decided at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do wonder what he wrote
Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl snatched up her sunbonnet and hurried out of the
door, the letter in her hand.&nbsp; Half-way to the old
man&rsquo;s cabin she met him hobbling cheerfully along by the
aid of his crutch.&nbsp; The satisfied smile on his face brought
Talitha&rsquo;s grievance freshly to mind; she almost resented
his unusually jovial greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo, thar, Tally; you shore air lookin&rsquo;
robustious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; responded Talitha
coldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got a letter from Martin,
and&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve been wondering what you told him.&nbsp;
He writes as though it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;well, he almost joked
about the schoolhouse being burned.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s
lips quivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law, now, did he?&rdquo; considered the old man,
evading the look of reproach in Talitha&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go fer to give him any sech idee.&nbsp; Hit
war a powerful mean thing fer Jake Simcox ter do, and I aimed ter
lay thet out plain ter Mart.&nbsp; S&rsquo;pose you jest walk
along with me ter the ruins.&nbsp; I thought a sight of thet old
shack; hit&rsquo;s whar I spent cornsiderable many years.&nbsp; I
like ter think of you-all a set-tin&rsquo; on them benches.&nbsp;
You war a powerful bouncin&rsquo; leetle gal, Tally, and I war an
ill enough teacher, but I done the best I knowed then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha&rsquo;s anger had suddenly vanished.&nbsp; There was
something pitiful in the schoolmaster&rsquo;s fondness for
recalling the past.&nbsp; After all, he felt the loss of the old
place more deeply than he would have people think.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; she insisted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course you did the best you could, but I know just how
you feel; I wish I&rsquo;d done more when I had the
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law, now, Tally, you&rsquo;re jest a colt, as hit war,
and thar&rsquo;s plenty of chances comin&rsquo; fer you.&nbsp;
Hit ain&rsquo;t as if you war sech a broken-down hoss critter as
I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t bear to give up the
school!&rdquo; cried the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
trying so hard to think of some way, and nobody seems to have the
least interest in it any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they now?&rdquo; said Si Quinn with
recovered cheerfulness.&nbsp; Then stopping suddenly,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Pears ter me suthin&rsquo;s been goin&rsquo; on up
this a way.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had come to where, through a
cleared space among the trees, a blackened heap was
visible&mdash;all that was left of the poor little
schoolhouse.</p>
<p>But Talitha hardly noticed it.&nbsp; Something beyond had
caught her eye&mdash;a substantial yet picturesque structure of
logs, the rough bark still covering them and adding a beauty in
harmony with the surroundings.&nbsp; The carefully laid chimney
at one end was receiving the last finishing touches at the hands
of a capable mason from the Settlement.&nbsp; A dozen men stood
about watching him admiringly.</p>
<p>The old man saw Talitha&rsquo;s eyes widen in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is it?&rdquo; she cried suddenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, honey,&rdquo; chuckled Si Quinn, &ldquo;I
reckon thet&rsquo;s the joke Mart writ you &rsquo;bout, and I
declar&rsquo; if hit ain&rsquo;t the biggest one I ever heerd
tell on.&nbsp; Hit&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ter be all ready fer you
ter begin school Monday, and nobody war goin&rsquo; ter say
anythin&rsquo; ter you &rsquo;bout hit till thet time; but I see
I jest had ter, you war frettin&rsquo; so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>The
new schoolhouse was a most pretentious affair in the eyes of its
builders.&nbsp; The logs were carefully chinked to keep out the
cold, and the three good-sized windows contained shining panes of
glass.&nbsp; Inside, there were backs to the rough benches.&nbsp;
Desks, the amateur carpenters had felt unable to cope with, but
there was a little platform with a rude table for the
teacher.&nbsp; A large sheet-iron stove gave promise of warming
the farthest corners of the room.</p>
<p>It was all so far beyond Talitha&rsquo;s most ambitious dreams
that she sank upon a seat and burst into tears.&nbsp; The men
looked at her abashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law me, Tally,&rdquo; expostulated Sam Coyle,
&ldquo;hit looks fairly ongrateful fer you ter take on
that-a-way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now shet up, Sam,&rdquo; commanded the schoolmaster
with his old authority.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tally&rsquo;s jest as
tickled as anybody, but hit&rsquo;s all come so mighty sudden
she&rsquo;s kerried plumb off her feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say I was!&rdquo; laughed the girl, wiping her
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never dreamed of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next Monday morning Talitha sang all the way to
school.&nbsp; The air was frosty and a nipping wind reddened her
cheeks and made her fingers tingle, but she laughed a merry
defiance at the cold.&nbsp; How warm and cosy the new schoolhouse
should be when the children <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>came trooping in.&nbsp; A turn in
the worn footpath and there it stood before her, new and
inviting, beckoning her on.&nbsp; Some one had been there before
her, for smoke came from the chimney.&nbsp; The young teacher
hastened her steps.&nbsp; The door was unlocked and she
entered.&nbsp; The place was empty but warm to the farthest nook,
and Talitha rubbed her eyes.&nbsp; There were familiar looking
books on the table and maps on the walls beside the wide
stretches of blackboard.&nbsp; There were pictures also, not just
such as she would have chosen, but how they brightened the
place!&nbsp; &ldquo;If hit&rsquo;s picters Tally wants, why
hit&rsquo;s picters she shall hev,&rdquo; declared the
storekeeper at the Settlement.&nbsp; And forthwith he had
gathered his accumulation of calendars, chromo advertisements,
and picture cards to beautify the schoolroom.</p>
<p>For a time Talitha&rsquo;s heart was as light as a feather,
then something began to trouble her.&nbsp; Quite by accident she
discovered that Si Quinn&rsquo;s funds were getting low.&nbsp;
How little he could afford to replace the books and maps which
had been destroyed she did not imagine.&nbsp; She only knew that
he seemed to have grown paler and thinner each time she saw
him.&nbsp; He had a habit of dropping in at the school almost
daily, and when a week passed and he did not appear, Talitha
called at the cabin.</p>
<p>She knocked, but there was no response and she opened the door
with misgiving.&nbsp; The old man was not there.&nbsp; She looked
curiously <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>around; the remnants of a scanty meal were on the
table, and with a sudden inspiration she began to investigate the
condition of his larder.&nbsp; The girl stood amazed at the
result.&nbsp; She knew he had not been able to cultivate his
little garden patch the past summer, but because of the small sum
he had earned for years in the Goose Creek school, Si Quinn had
been looked upon as a well-to-do man in the community.</p>
<p>Much troubled at her discovery, Talitha set her wits to
work.&nbsp; The old man was too proud, she knew, to accept any
offers of assistance.&nbsp; Suddenly a plan entered her
head.&nbsp; Christmas was only three weeks distant&mdash;that was
her opportunity, only something must be done meanwhile.&nbsp;
Where could he have gone?&nbsp; The girl ran to the door and
looked out.&nbsp; There he was now coming along the creek
path.&nbsp; She hurried out to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Tally!&rdquo; he called, a smile brightening the
wan, haggard face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you everywhere,&rdquo;
cried the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you home
with me for supper and I know father and mother won&rsquo;t hear
to your coming back to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old schoolmaster needed little urging to accompany her,
and he did ample justice to the supper Talitha cooked with her
own hands.&nbsp; The next morning a drizzling sleet prevented him
from leaving.&nbsp; It was almost <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>a week before he finally took his
departure, and then it was to respond to an urgent invitation
from the Gooch family to visit them.&nbsp; The Shackleys would
also be offended if they were neglected, so before the rounds
were made, Si Quinn&rsquo;s face lost its pallor and he was quite
like himself again.</p>
<p>One morning Pom Ethers, the wagoner, stopped at the
schoolhouse with a goodly sized wooden box.&nbsp; &ldquo;Talitha
Coyle&rdquo; was painted on it in large black letters.&nbsp; The
children gathered around while the man, with much curiosity,
opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laws-a-massy!&rdquo; exclaimed Porn Ethers as the cover
came off.&nbsp; &ldquo;If they ain&rsquo;t all books!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;ll ye ever do with sech a heap of &rsquo;em,
Tally?&rdquo;&nbsp; There were two dozen volumes in neat but
cheap bindings; some new to the young teacher, and others she had
read over and over in the school library at Bentville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read and study them of course,&rdquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just what we&rsquo;ve needed
all the time.&nbsp; Who could have sent them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit beats me,&rdquo; said the wagoner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thar ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; ter show whar they come
from; mebbe the schoolmaster can tell ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Si Quinn did not seem to know who the unknown donor might be,
although he might have surmised, for the very next day he
received a letter containing five dollars wrapped in an unsigned
epistle, stating that the sender <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>had found a place at good
wages.&nbsp; After Christmas he was going to school&mdash;working
evenings for his keep.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster smiled and nodded knowingly as he read it
over and over to himself, then laid the sheets on the flame in
the wide fireplace and watched them turn to ashes.</p>
<p>It took a great deal of scheming on Talitha&rsquo;s part to
bring her plans to maturity.&nbsp; Billy Gooch was her right hand
man, who could keep a secret better than some of his
elders.&nbsp; Her younger brothers, Rufe and Dock, were too small
to be of much service, while most of her other pupils lived too
far away to help her after school hours.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve there were to be exercises at the schoolhouse,
which was to be trimmed with evergreen and holly for the
occasion.&nbsp; Talitha had heard of Christmas trees, although
she had never seen one, but they meant candles, glittering
trimmings, and little gifts far beyond the reach of her small
purse.</p>
<p>The schoolhouse looked like Santa Claus&rsquo; bower when the
last decoration was in place.&nbsp; From every available spot
glowed the red berries of the holly, with their shining green
leaves against a background of pine and fir.&nbsp; At last she
was free to go.&nbsp; With one last look of satisfaction she
locked the door, and, accompanied by Billy and Sudie, took her
way to the old schoolmaster&rsquo;s cabin.&nbsp; She did not see
the faces peering excitedly out at her <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>from behind
the pine thicket where, on that memorable night, Jake Simcox had
thought himself safe from detection.</p>
<p>Si Quinn had not finished his stay at the Shackleys, so the
coast was clear.&nbsp; The Saturday before Talitha, with the aid
of Billy and his sister, had given the cabin such a scrubbing as
it had never known.&nbsp; The fireplace was newly whitewashed and
filled with odorous pine and balsam boughs.&nbsp; There was also
a huge pile of wood in one corner of the room.&nbsp; Only the
finishing touches were lacking to make the preparations complete
for the great surprise to be precipitated upon the schoolmaster,
and in these all his former patrons were to have a hand.</p>
<p>The children had brought their arms full of holly and pine,
and now they ran out for more while Talitha tried to give a
festive air to the poor little place.&nbsp; She smiled to herself
as she did so, wondering meanwhile what the old man would say to
such &ldquo;vanities&rdquo;&mdash;as he would have called them a
year ago.</p>
<p>Presently there was a heavy step at the door, and Porn Ethers
staggered in, his arms weighted with bundles of all shapes and
sizes.&nbsp; There was a veritable Santa Claus twinkle in the
grey eyes under the shaggy eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s a heap more things in the wagon,
Tally.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t git hit nearer&rsquo;n the big
rock, but I can pack &rsquo;em up easy &rsquo;nough, I
reckon.&nbsp; Law, but Si&rsquo;ll think hit air Chris&rsquo;mus
fer sure!&nbsp; <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Thar&rsquo;s three flitches of bacon and a ham, and
Mis&rsquo; Spurlock&rsquo;s sent one of her
puddin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; enumerated the wagoner as he deposited the
offerings upon the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Shackleys and the
Twilligers hev fairly outdone theirselves.&nbsp; What I&rsquo;m
afeard of is thet now the schoolmaster&rsquo;ll be gittin&rsquo;
the dyspepsy; too much eatin&rsquo; air right down
onhealthy&mdash;so I&rsquo;ve heerd.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d be
willin&rsquo; ter take the resk if hit war me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
grey eyes twinkled again.</p>
<p>Billy and Sudie came in with another armful of greens and
hurried to Porn Ethers&rsquo; assistance.&nbsp; In a
comparatively short time the contents of the wagon were neatly
stowed away on the shelves, the bed made up with the new blankets
and blue coverlet, and the table set in Talitha&rsquo;s most
approved fashion with some of the choicest goodies surrounding a
large bunch of holly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the fire is burning and the candles lighted
it&rsquo;ll look real Christmas-y,&rdquo; decided the young
teacher as the finishing touches were completed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall have to run ahead and see to that.&nbsp; How I wish Martin
were here to-night,&rdquo; she sighed as she started
homeward.</p>
<h2><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

CHRISTMAS DOINGS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dusk of Christmas Eve had
gathered when Talitha set out for the schoolhouse, leaving the
rest of the family to follow later.&nbsp; The place was already
warm, but the candles must be lighted; the company would gather
at an early hour.&nbsp; Already there was the sound of wheels,
the tread of oxen on the wagon track, and the chatter of
voices.&nbsp; Every man, woman, and child in Goose Creek, able to
hobble forth, would be present.</p>
<p>As she neared the place she saw that light already flamed from
the windows.&nbsp; Her steps quickened into a run; she reached
the schoolhouse quite breathless.&nbsp; The door was ajar.&nbsp;
Talitha pushed it open and entered.&nbsp; At first she was only
aware that something very puzzling was going on.&nbsp; She rubbed
her eyes&mdash;they were dazed with the light&mdash;and looked
again.</p>
<p>On the platform was a Christmas tree, so tall that the flame
of its topmost candle barely escaped the ceiling.&nbsp; The
twinkling lights, the glittering tinsel, the toys, made it the
most beautiful thing Talitha had ever seen.&nbsp; Several people
were moving about it lighting more <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>candles and hanging small, red
stockings, with bulging sides, to the lower branches.&nbsp; Did
her eyes deceive her?&nbsp; Was one of them&mdash;yes, it was
really Martin, and there was Miss Howard, and Abner, and
Gincy!</p>
<p>The latter rushed forward and caught Talitha in her
arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been planning for it ever so long;
I was determined to come home with the boys and surprise
you,&rdquo; laughed Gincy with a hug.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then we coaxed
Miss Howard to come too, and when the Bentville folks heard about
the school and what you&rsquo;d done, they wanted to help, so
there&rsquo;s something on the tree for every pupil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Tally,&rdquo; Abner interrupted excitedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is a dandy schoolhouse!&nbsp; I should think
you&rsquo;d be awfully &rsquo;bliged to Jake Simcox for
burnin&rsquo; that old shack&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo;&nbsp; Talitha held up a warning finger, for
a crowd was flocking in at the door.&nbsp; Foremost were the
Shackleys with Si Quinn.&nbsp; At first the company looked about
bewildered, then their tongues suddenly loosened and the din was
deafening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fer the land&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; exclaimed Ann Bills,
with a violent poke of her elbow in her husband&rsquo;s ribs,
&ldquo;jest look at thet pine, will ye, all rigged out with
poppets and sech.&nbsp; Whar d&rsquo;ye s&rsquo;pose Tally got
all thet plunder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon hit war packed all the way from
Bentville,&rdquo; Shad Bills answered shrewdly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s Miss Howard over
yon&mdash;and&mdash;I&rsquo;m <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>blest if hit ain&rsquo;t Mart and
Abner lightin&rsquo; them candles!&nbsp; The young-uns hev come
back fer Chris&rsquo;mus, Ann&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But his wife
did not hear, her keen eyes had spied Gincy, and she was already
elbowing her way through the crowd in a masterful fashion.</p>
<p>Half-dazed, the aged schoolmaster glanced around; it was all
very strange&mdash;and beautiful, too.&nbsp; His faded old eyes
winked and blinked at the unaccustomed twinkle and glitter.&nbsp;
It almost took his breath and he dropped trembling, into a
seat.&nbsp; How could Talitha have thought of all this!&nbsp; Did
they have such things at Bentville?&nbsp; All the years of his
teaching he had never once dreamed of celebrating Christmas in
this fashion.&nbsp; He eyed the tree&mdash;what he could see of
it over the heads of the crowd&mdash;with all a child&rsquo;s
delight.&nbsp; How shining and stately it looked!&nbsp; Its
tallest candle glittered like a star, while those among the holly
and pine, around the room, shone back bravely as though they were
not to be outdone.&nbsp; And how the folks chattered!</p>
<p>Talitha slipped away to find Martin.&nbsp; She wanted to meet
him alone, although that seemed an impossibility, but she darted
around the tree and caught him tucking away a parcel under the
branches at the base.&nbsp; How tall and manly he looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tally!&rdquo; he exclaimed, beaming at her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did we surprise you?&rdquo;&nbsp; He stooped and kissed
her.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>Talitha only nodded; she could not trust her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see now why you came back, Tally,&rdquo; Martin
began, but he did not finish, for the two were suddenly besieged
by Abner and Gincy and dragged before the surprised company who
had not yet discovered Martin.</p>
<p>It was quite a few minutes before the excited audience settled
into quiet, and then it was as decorous and interested as one
could wish.&nbsp; Miss Howard could hardly have presided with
more dignity than did Talitha, and the exercises went off better
than either could have believed possible with those alluring
gifts before the children&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The dialogue between the Twilliger twins went smoothly without
prompting.&nbsp; The youngest Dodd boy&mdash;small for his ten
years and one of the brightest pupils&mdash;recited &ldquo;The
Night Before Christmas&rdquo; like a general, and received long
and vociferous applause, as did also the song by little Polly
Suttle.&nbsp; Billy Gooch came in for a large share of approval
at his rendering of Lincoln&rsquo;s speech at Gettysburg; there
was a marching drill in which Rufe Coyle beat the time on an old
drum of his grandfather&mdash;who had been through the war.&nbsp;
The vigorous rat-a-tat-tat set the men&rsquo;s restless feet
tapping to the great delight of the children.&nbsp; The exercises
were at last concluded with the singing of the &ldquo;Star
Spangled Banner&rdquo; by the school, the younger <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>pupils
waving small flags through the chorus.</p>
<p>At the close of the song, Miss Howard, with the aid of Martin
and Abner, began to distribute the gifts from the tree.&nbsp;
Minta Bills was the first name called, but the child failed to
understand and hung back timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye hear Miss Howard callin&rsquo; ye?&nbsp;
Go &rsquo;long, honey,&rdquo; coaxed her father, giving the child
a gentle push.&nbsp; He did not comprehend just what was wanted,
but the young woman from Bentville must be obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minty! whar&rsquo;s yer raisin&rsquo;?&rdquo; reproved
Ann Bills, turning sharply to her granddaughter.&nbsp; Minta
edged shyly toward the tree, and Miss Howard put a stocking full
of candy and a small but gaily dressed doll into her arms,
watching the look of astonishment and delight grow in her
face.&nbsp; At the sight of the latter all the mother instinct
was aroused, and she stumbled back to her father, hugging her
precious burden close.&nbsp; All Goose Creek watched her.&nbsp;
The big blue eyes were fastened on the doll, and the long yellow
curls fashioned a sort of halo for the sweet, childish face.</p>
<p>Ann Bills&rsquo; hard mouth twitched and she gave Minta a
kindly pat as she bent over to view the gift at closer
range.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hit do beat all,&rdquo; she told her son in
an audible whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thet thar poppet fairly looks
like a human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few minutes Minta was the envy of the school, but it was
soon discovered that none of the pupils had been
overlooked&mdash;that <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>even their teacher had been
remembered with enough &ldquo;store goods&rdquo; for a new gown,
the package Martin was hiding under the branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, if I didn&rsquo;t forget all about the
schoolmaster,&rdquo; Martin whispered to Talitha.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; his sister gave a start.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I
did too.&nbsp; Martin, I&rsquo;m going right over to speak to
Enoch Shackley, and in ten minutes you must follow me.&nbsp; Just
slip away without any one seeing you; I&rsquo;ll be waiting
outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Halfway across the room Talitha was waylaid by a tall,
black-eyed girl with a conspicuous pompadour.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
reckon you don&rsquo;t know me, I &rsquo;lowed you
wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;at first sight, anyway, but I war on the
train the mornin&rsquo; you come from Bentville and you told me
&rsquo;bout Gincy&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ter school.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t find out your name, but when I heerd &rsquo;bout a
gal comin&rsquo; back here to Goose Creek to teach school I
pieced hit all together and I knew hit war you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Piny Twilliger?&rdquo; inquired Talitha
politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re jest right.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a
powerful fine time, and I&rsquo;ve been a-tellin&rsquo; Gincy
thet I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; ter Bentville too, next term.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve changed my mind &rsquo;bout gittin&rsquo;
larnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha made her escape as soon as possible, although Piny
would have liked to prolong the conversation.&nbsp; With a
whispered word in Enoch Shackley&rsquo;s ear she slipped out of
the door unnoticed.</p>
<h2><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

GOOSE CREEK PLOTS AGAINST THE SCHOOLMASTER</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hit</span> air gittin&rsquo;
powerful late,&rdquo; admonished Enoch Shackley, rounding up the
last of his brood.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can take you-uns along ter your
place,&rdquo; he said to the schoolmaster.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon
you&rsquo;re honin&rsquo; ter git home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s face suddenly fell.&nbsp; Never within his
memory had he spent so festive an evening, and now to go from it
to his cold, comfortless cabin.&nbsp; The blacksmith observed the
look with an unfeeling smile, and attempted to hasten his
offspring&rsquo;s preparations for departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up thar, chil&rsquo;ren.&nbsp; Law me, your
teacher&rsquo;s gone &rsquo;fore this.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s glad
&rsquo;nough ter git shet o&rsquo; you fer one spell, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It certainly was a mystery where Talitha and Martin had so
suddenly disappeared.&nbsp; Even Abner and Gincy looked puzzled,
finally accepting Mr. Shackley&rsquo;s offer&mdash;made with a
knowing twinkle of the eye&mdash;of a &ldquo;couple of
cheers&rdquo; in his wagon.</p>
<p>The company flocked out of the schoolhouse <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>with their
perforated tin lanterns like a swarm of fireflies dodging hither
and thither among the trees.&nbsp; Saddle horses were mounted,
and the patient oxen again yoked to the wagons filled with
chairs.</p>
<p>Strange to say, many of the folks were taking the same
road&mdash;following a short distance behind the Shackleys.&nbsp;
The sound of their voices and the twinkling lights in the rear at
any other time would have aroused Si Quinn&rsquo;s curiosity, at
least.&nbsp; Now he was too much occupied with the thought of his
own failures and the future which loomed before him more dismal
than ever.&nbsp; Lost in revery he failed to notice when the oxen
stopped at the footpath leading up to his cabin, until the
blacksmith&rsquo;s voice roused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you air, Si!&nbsp; Jest let me ketch a holt of
you.&nbsp; Middlin&rsquo; dampish, ain&rsquo;t hit?&nbsp; I
&rsquo;low Abner better go &rsquo;long with the lantern.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll wait fer him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had the two looked around as they slowly climbed the slope,
they would have seen the shadowy company following at a little
distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stop and start a fire for you,&rdquo;
offered Abner, with a great feeling of pity for the old man who
leaned heavily on his strong, young arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
haven&rsquo;t been home for a week it ain&rsquo;t a fit place for
you to go into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar won&rsquo;t be a live coal,&rdquo; panted the
schoolmaster.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve matches in my pocket, but it&rsquo;ll
take a considerable spell to drive out the cold and
damp.&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy eyed the dim outlines of the cabin
with misgiving.&nbsp; It looked gloomy and unhomelike as
possible.</p>
<p>Once at the door&mdash;guiltless of fastenings&mdash;Si Quinn
drew a long, reluctant sigh.</p>
<p>His hand on the latch, Abner heard sounds of feet close
by.&nbsp; He looked around; there were strange, moving shadows on
the path.&nbsp; He was not slow-witted; it was Christmas Eve and
a suspicion of something flashed across his mind.&nbsp; One
glimpse of the already lighted room and he turned, helped the old
man in, and hastily closed the door just as there came a tugging
at his coat.&nbsp; A score of Goose Creek folks were behind
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what did he say?&rdquo; whispered Talitha
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t got that far,&rdquo; grinned Abner in
sudden comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give three cheers for the
schoolmaster,&rdquo; suggested Martin.</p>
<p>Such a demonstration was new to the mountain people who had
not been to Bentville, but they listened with appreciation and
joined in most lustily when it ended with: &ldquo;A Merry
Christmas!&nbsp; Wish You a Merry Christmas!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then the company quietly dispersed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made a power o&rsquo; racket,&rdquo; said Dan Gooch
as later he entered his own cabin.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d
like ter hev seen how the old man looked <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>when he war
fairly inside.&nbsp; We did a toler&rsquo;ble job, chinkin&rsquo;
up them crannies.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d never hev suspected what the
place war like,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>
<p>As more than one of the company around the little old cabin
that night had surmised, the schoolmaster&rsquo;s face, as he
gazed about the room&mdash;only a few days ago as cheerless as it
could well be&mdash;was worth seeing.&nbsp; The pine boughs in
the fireplace crackled and snapped merrily as the flames leaped
upward and sent a delightful glow through the place.&nbsp; A
half-dozen candles twinkled out from bunches of holly and
pine.&nbsp; The bed with its warm, new covering was like a gay
flower plot; shelves and table bore unmistakable evidences of
Christmas cheer.</p>
<p>The faded eyes grew misty as they caught sight of a card on
the shelf above the fireplace.&nbsp; It bore, in large letters:
&ldquo;A Merry Christmas from the Goose Creek Folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s knees suddenly weakened and he dropped
into a chair.&nbsp; He heard the cheering and tried to rise and
open the door, but he could not summon strength.&nbsp; As the
last echo of &ldquo;Merry Christmas&rdquo; died away across the
mountains with the sound of retreating footsteps, the tears
trickled down his cheeks.&nbsp; It was the happiest hour of his
whole life.&nbsp; His poor efforts had been appreciated after
all; he was not to be forgotten in his old age.</p>
<p>Until a much later hour than usual lights <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>shone from
the little homes about Goose Creek.&nbsp; The young people had
loitered along the way from the schoolhouse, there was so much to
talk over.&nbsp; Miss Howard was to stay all night with
Gincy.&nbsp; The Coyle and Gooch families were to spend Christmas
at the home of the former.&nbsp; It was to be a great day for the
two households, and Talitha&rsquo;s head was awhirl with
excitement.&nbsp; She had unselfishly worked hard to bring
happiness to others, and the greatest surprise had come to
her.&nbsp; She was going back to Bentville the day after
Christmas, with Miss Howard, and Martin, and the rest.&nbsp;
Gincy, hawk-eyed where her friend was concerned, had rushed to
the dean when she discovered that two of the students were to
leave, and engaged a place for Talitha.&nbsp; Piney Twilliger had
been fortunate enough to secure the other.</p>
<p>Sam Coyle made no objection, he was secretly bubbling over
with pride at his daughter&rsquo;s success.&nbsp; There could be
no more school that winter; besides, he was beginning to feel
that an education was something to be really desired.</p>
<p>By dawn on Christmas day two households at least were
astir.&nbsp; The air was unusually mild with the fresh smell of a
recent shower.&nbsp; The sun rose and beamed down with the warmth
of May.&nbsp; By the time the Coyle family had breakfasted, Gincy
and Abner were on hand to assist in the preparations.&nbsp; The
loom, <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>warping bars, spinning wheel, and a rude chest were
turned out of doors to make place for the expected guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re real lucky to have such weather,&rdquo;
said Talitha.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how we would ever
have managed with the table if we couldn&rsquo;t have cleared
things away.&nbsp; As it is there won&rsquo;t be room enough for
the children&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll knock something together that&rsquo;ll be
nearer their size,&rdquo; comforted Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; smiled his sister, much
relieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was thinking of setting them in a row on
the floor.&nbsp; That wouldn&rsquo;t be very Christmas-y, would
it?&nbsp; But a table of their own will pleasure them
mightily.&rdquo;&nbsp; Talitha hustled back into the cabin; there
was an unusual amount of work for even her capable hands.&nbsp;
Besides assisting in the preparation of so elaborate a meal, her
belongings were to be made ready for her departure early on the
morrow.&nbsp; It was too late in the season to risk further
delay.&nbsp; Any day now, winter might rush upon the mountains
with icy wind and sleet or a blinding snowstorm, making the rough
roads altogether impassable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This air a weather breeder,&rdquo; observed Sam Coyle
pessimistically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel a sight easier if
you-uns hed a-started this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; miss their Chris&rsquo;mus turkey,&rdquo;
reproved his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jest be thankful hit air fine
&rsquo;nough ter turn things out&rsquo;n doors, &rsquo;though
Tally &rsquo;lows now, hit would hev pleasured the comp&rsquo;ny
<a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>more ter
hev set the table &rsquo;long of them pines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit air not so much &rsquo;count whar hit&rsquo;s set
as what&rsquo;s set on hit,&rdquo; retorted Sam jovially.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thet air the main thing; the scener-y hain&rsquo;t needed
ter give me an appetite.&nbsp; The smell o&rsquo; them turkeys
air gone to my stummick a&rsquo;ready, an&rsquo; I reckon I
sh&rsquo;ll hev ter take ter the crick ter git out&rsquo;n reach
of hit if the dinner&rsquo;s later&rsquo;n common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be keerful you don&rsquo;t fall in,&rdquo; warned Mrs.
Coyle sarcastically.&nbsp; She paused in the midst of her egg
beating to look about for Dock, her youngest, who was prone to
get into mischief if unwatched.</p>
<p>By ten o&rsquo;clock the company had arrived.&nbsp; It
included the Bills family, as being next of kin, and Miss Howard
who had waited to come with Mrs. Gooch and the younger
children.&nbsp; Martin and Abner made themselves as useful as
possible by taking the smaller members of the assembled families
a short distance along the mountain-side in search of the hickory
nuts which might have escaped their eyes at nutting time.</p>
<p>The company sat out of doors and visited with the host, while
Talitha and her mother, with Gincy&rsquo;s aid, completed the
final preparations for the Christmas feast.&nbsp; The
children&rsquo;s table was laid beside a clump of laurel.&nbsp;
When the youngsters appeared, they were immediately set down
before well-filled plates while <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>their elders gathered in the
cabin.&nbsp; The family table had been lengthened by
Martin&rsquo;s skilful contriving and placed cornerwise across
the room.&nbsp; Even then it took some managing to get the guests
properly seated.</p>
<p>Mrs. Coyle surveyed the feast with pardonable pride; it would
have done credit to more notable housewives.&nbsp; Not since the
early days of her marriage had she had the opportunity to show
such hospitality.&nbsp; Two of the largest, plumpest turkeys in
her flock graced the centre of the board in company with a fat,
wild goose, potatoes, turnips, beans, squash, dishes of pickle, a
salad&mdash;Talitha had learned to make at
Bentville&mdash;besides the usual Christmas pies, and a large
black cake Gincy had trimmed with a wreath of holly.&nbsp; Both
front and back doors were wide open, and a gentle breeze cooled
the heated room where both the new stove and the fireplace had
been doing extra duty.</p>
<p>Around the little cabin rose the great sheltering hills, their
peaks a misty purple in the soft haze of a belated Indian
summer.&nbsp; Below, Goose Creek, still little more than a
rivulet, basked lazily in the sunshine.</p>
<p>At first the appetites were too keen to allow of much
conversation, but at last Shad Bills laid down his knife and fork
and looked around with a grin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has anybody heerd how
the schoolmaster&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he suddenly
inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;I &rsquo;lowed a-toppin&rsquo; off the
Chris&rsquo;mus doin&rsquo;s <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>with thet surprise war a leetle too
much fer the old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seen him this mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Dan
Gooch.&nbsp; &ldquo;He war as peart as a Juny bug.&nbsp; The
Twilligers give him an invite to eat turkey with them.&nbsp; Yes,
sir,&rdquo; he smiled reminiscently, &ldquo;I reckon Goose Creek
never see no sech doin&rsquo;s as we had last night.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t rightly know as we&rsquo;d ought ter let Tally slip
off this-a-way without writin&rsquo; out a promise thet
she&rsquo;ll come back and teach the school next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam Coyle grinned appreciatively.&nbsp; Not one of the men in
the company could read or write.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon her word
of mouth&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; Tally&rsquo;s boun&rsquo; ter come
back all right,&rdquo; her father declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t always be comin&rsquo; back to
teach,&rdquo; put in Gincy.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you go to
Commencement next spring maybe you&rsquo;ll want Tally to have a
diploma, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam Coyle wisely refrained from a reply.&nbsp; That he had not
looked with favour upon his daughter&rsquo;s ambition to get an
education was well known, and now that he had been proved in the
wrong he did not propose to lay himself open to further
criticism.&nbsp; However, he inwardly determined that Talitha
should keep the Goose Creek school.&nbsp; The money was a great
help to the family, and Dan Gooch would like nothing better than
to have a chance to secure it for Gincy, he reasoned
selfishly.&nbsp; Miss Howard shrewdly read the man&rsquo;s
thoughts, <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>but she said nothing, although she inwardly resolved
that Talitha should have her chance with the rest.</p>
<p>After the dinner was over and the dishes cleared away, the
young people went to the schoolhouse.&nbsp; The maps and pictures
were to be brought home for safekeeping, although there was no
probable danger of their being molested.&nbsp; Besides, the young
teacher wanted to see the place again before leaving for
Bentville.</p>
<p>There was a strong odour of pine as Martin flung open the
door.&nbsp; The despoiled tree still stood on the platform.&nbsp;
Miss Howard had put the tinsel trimmings carefully away for
future Christmases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks as though we had had a good time
last night,&rdquo; said Talitha, glancing around.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Billy, I think I&rsquo;ll let you and Sudie sweep out when
you have a chance.&nbsp; You may keep the greens up as long as
you choose; they&rsquo;ll last some time.&nbsp; Good-bye until
next summer,&rdquo; she said to herself as she reluctantly turned
away.</p>
<p>They stopped a moment at the little heap of ashes and charred
logs below the new structure.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fitting
monument for the old shack we used to call a schoolhouse,&rdquo;
said Martin reflectively.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I remember the days
we spent in it, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Talitha gently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The schoolmaster did the best he knew.&nbsp; He can see
his <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>mistakes as well as anybody now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss
Howard was silent, but she thought of the many such places
scattered over the mountains, some of them presided over by just
such teachers as Si Quinn had been.</p>
<p>Early that evening Martin and Talitha slipped away to the old
schoolmaster&rsquo;s cabin to say good-bye, for they would start
by light the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;lowed you&rsquo;d be &rsquo;long,&rdquo; he
said, beaming down at them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I came home early
so&rsquo;s not ter miss you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we wouldn&rsquo;t have gone away without coming to
see you,&rdquo; Talitha assured him, drawing up a stool before
the bright blaze in the fireplace.&nbsp; Martin seated himself
upon an old chest in the corner and looked around.&nbsp; He had
been curious to see how Talitha had managed to rehabilitate the
dingy place of which he had such disagreeable recollections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know my old shack now, would
you?&rdquo; Si Quinn noticed the young fellow&rsquo;s survey of
the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;You kin lay the hull thing ter Tally,
I&rsquo;ll be boun&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; protested the girl, blushing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I just&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know your sly tricks?&nbsp; You started
hit an&rsquo; did a heap besides.&nbsp; Not that Goose Creek
folks ain&rsquo;t the frien&rsquo;liest, best-hearted critters in
the hull mountings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think what you&rsquo;ve done for me!&rdquo; cried
Talitha in a low tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those books <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>and
maps&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t have replaced them this
fall&mdash;and that box was such a godsend!&nbsp; Billy&rsquo;s
going to see that all the children have a chance to read the
books this winter.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be learning a lot and the
days won&rsquo;t seem so long.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send them a
package of papers and magazines in the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law me, Tally, hit war little &rsquo;nough I did.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d hev done a heap more, but I couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Hit&rsquo;ll seem mighty lonesome with you-uns gone, but
I&rsquo;ll git some comfort thinkin&rsquo; of the chanct
you&rsquo;re havin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The call must necessarily be a brief one.&nbsp; Talitha was
very tired and there was a long ride before them on the
morrow.&nbsp; But as the two rose to go the old man caught at the
girl&rsquo;s sleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;Martin, you jest g&rsquo;long
and bide fer Tally by the big tree.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
somethin&rsquo; special ter say ter her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin looked surprised, but he obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I war told ter keep hit a secret, Tally,&rdquo; said Si
Quinn as the door closed behind her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
couldn&rsquo;t let you go &rsquo;way a-thinkin&rsquo; I sent you
thet box, fer I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll trust you never
ter speak of hit long as I live if I tell you.&nbsp; Hit war Jake
Simcox&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; Talitha stopped short in
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s repented of his folly and is
turnin&rsquo; over a new leaf.&nbsp; He air a good piece from
Goose Creek and he&rsquo;s got a chanct ter work an&rsquo; go ter
school.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s more, he <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>&rsquo;lows ter make up&mdash;some
time&mdash;fer all the mischief he done.&nbsp; But he war sech a
pore ignorunt feller&mdash;I reckon you&rsquo;ve fergiven him,
Tally, hit worked out a sight o&rsquo; good fer you and fer Goose
Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, indeed!&rdquo; cried the girl, the tears in
her eyes, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m so glad he&rsquo;s having a
chance.&nbsp; I wish you&rsquo;d tell him so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t likely I&rsquo;ll ever see him
agin, but he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ter make a man of himself yit, I
reckon.&rdquo;&nbsp; The schoolmaster looked down at his
favourite pupil and there was a smile on his face that softened
the plain, rugged features like sunshine from within shining
outwardly.&nbsp; Standing in the glow of the firelight with the
Christmas holly and pine on shelf and wall, the twinkling
candles&mdash;he had lighted in honour of his guests&mdash;the
white-haired, white-bearded man seemed like the memory of an
old-time Christmas that had slipped back to its mountain home for
a brief renewal of past pleasures.</p>
<p>Talitha carried the picture away with her as she went
thoughtfully down the path toward the big pine where Martin
waited.</p>
<h2><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

THE &ldquo;STILL&rdquo; CAVE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> dawn the next morning, the
little party set forth for the return trip across the
mountains.&nbsp; The four had come the distance to Goose Creek on
horses and mules hired from the school farm.&nbsp; Talitha was
mounted on Dan Gooch&rsquo;s sorrel he had unselfishly lent her,
her father firmly refusing to allow his one mule to be taken from
the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;low they&rsquo;ll find room on the farm fer
the beastie, a spell,&rdquo; said Dan, anxious to show Talitha a
favour.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m reckonin&rsquo; on gettin&rsquo;
down ter Bentville myself, come spring, ter see what the school
air like and what you&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; thar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would make us a visit, Mr. Gooch,&rdquo;
urged Miss Howard, &ldquo;and then come back and tell the Goose
Creek folks all about it and bring them to
Commencement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never know whar ter stow &rsquo;em
all,&rdquo; Dan smiled broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put up some tents on the campus,&rdquo; put
in Gincy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ought to see what a splendid, big
place it is with such lovely trees&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we were starting,&rdquo; called
Martin in front, and the little cavalcade moved away.&nbsp; The
sorrel was in the rear, but the faithful old beast did his best,
and Talitha resolved that on reaching Bentville he should have a
well-earned rest until his master came after him.</p>
<p>There was a wintry chill in the air, which was not surprising
at that early hour.&nbsp; If the sun came out it would be
delightful travelling.&nbsp; Martin watched the sky a little
anxiously while the others laughed and chatted on
unheeding.&nbsp; At last, over the bald peak of the mountain, the
sun looked down at them through a veil of mist which gradually
disappeared.&nbsp; A cool wind was all that prevented the day
from being as delightful as the previous one had been.&nbsp; But
their progress would necessarily be slow, for the sorrel proved
to have little endurance.&nbsp; Talitha favoured him as much as
possible by keeping behind the others and slipping down
occasionally to walk beside him with encouraging pats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can easily get as far as Joe
Bradshaw&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
be looking for us about sundown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gorgeous colouring of autumn had gone from the mountains,
but there was still the holly with its scarlet berries, the green
of the laurel, the fir, and pine, and here and there, on hickory
and oak, a patch of colour where the leaves still clung.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>At
noon the party stopped for dinner in a hollow shielded from the
wind.&nbsp; They spread out the eatables which they had brought
in their saddlebags, on the thick, green grass.&nbsp; The horses
and mules were tethered to graze, after being watered at a
trickling rill which filtered out of the rocks close beside
them.</p>
<p>After lingering longer than usual to give the sorrel a chance
to rest, the company started on.&nbsp; Miss Howard looked at her
watch; it was half-past one.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just about
make it and that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; she commented to herself
cheerfully.</p>
<p>For some time after leaving the hollow they followed the dry
bed of a stream.&nbsp; The rocky bottom was covered with loose
stones, and now and then a small boulder jutted out from the
bank.&nbsp; They were in shadow, for hedging them in on either
side, rose the mountains thickly covered with pine.&nbsp; At last
they left the stream bed and turned into a trail leading over the
mountain.&nbsp; Rising above it was the ridge of still another
which they must cross before the Bradshaw home could be
sighted.</p>
<p>In the effort of guiding their animals into the trail, they
did not at first notice the change in the sky until suddenly
Martin, ahead, looked up.&nbsp; The sun had disappeared, and a
grey mist clung to the tall peaks.&nbsp; The air had grown
cold&mdash;a sudden drop of the temperature&mdash;which was an
unmistakable sign of the <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>approaching storm.&nbsp; He did not
call out to startle those in the rear, but on reaching a small
cove he turned the mule he was riding into it, and beckoned to
the others.&nbsp; They were coming up Indian file, and one by one
halted beside him&mdash;all but Talitha.&nbsp; Martin could see
her some distance below them.&nbsp; Something had happened to the
sorrel, for his sister had dismounted and was leading it with
difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a storm coming up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss
Howard shivered and looked around anxiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s growing colder every minute, I do believe; I
never knew such a sudden change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been coming on since noon only we were so
sheltered we didn&rsquo;t notice it,&rdquo; returned
Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just hold Jack and I&rsquo;ll go back and
help Talitha,&rdquo; slipping the mule&rsquo;s rein into
Abner&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The sorrel clung to the trail with three feet; the fourth was
evidently disabled.&nbsp; The animal&rsquo;s ears were laid back
and there was a despairing look in his eyes.&nbsp; Vainly Talitha
tugged at the rein while she gently urged him on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Martin inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s all tuckered out for one thing, then
he&rsquo;s got something in his foot&mdash;a sharp stone, I
reckon, for he&rsquo;s limped ever since he left the creek
bed.&nbsp; Poor thing, I might have known he couldn&rsquo;t stand
such a jaunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With difficulty Martin got down and examined the injured
member.&nbsp; It did not take him <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>long, with the aid of his
jack-knife, to extract the offending stone, which had cut an ugly
gash.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, that feels better, doesn&rsquo;t it,
old fellow?&nbsp; Just see if you can&rsquo;t step along
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; He stroked the animal&rsquo;s nose
coaxingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go ahead, Tally, and
we&rsquo;ll follow.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tired sorrel plucked up
courage and limped after.</p>
<p>When they reached the cove Abner silently pointed to the peaks
on the opposite range, and Martin saw with dismay that they were
nearly buried in a storm of flying snowflakes which was gradually
drawing nearer.&nbsp; The boys&rsquo; faces whitened as their
eyes met.&nbsp; If they had been alone it would be serious enough
with the prospect of a heavy snowfall to wipe out the trail, but
with Miss Howard and the girls to look after&mdash;Martin felt a
shiver, which was not from the cold wind, creep over him.&nbsp;
It was Miss Howard herself who finally spoke with a calm
decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, have you plenty of matches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they both answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have enough left from our lunch to make quite a
respectable supper.&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s perfectly useless to
think of going on to-night, I can see that; the sorrel
can&rsquo;t endure it for one thing and the storm would overtake
us before we were halfway down the mountain.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
got to camp out for the night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where?&rdquo; inquired Talitha, looking around in
bewilderment.&nbsp; How bleak and <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>lonely the mountains looked, how
shadowy they were growing already!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, girls, we&rsquo;re not going to
worry,&rdquo; Miss Howard said cheerfully, noticing the troubled
faces.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve discovered that this is the very
place where we were caught in a heavy rain storm when I was out
on extension work with Professor and Mrs. Denny, and we found
such a nice place to spend the night.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;m not
mistaken I can go right to it&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; A snowflake
struck Miss Howard&rsquo;s cheek, another and another.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t any time to spare.&nbsp; Come on and
don&rsquo;t lose sight of me for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, please, Miss Howard,&rdquo; called Martin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tally must ride Jack and I&rsquo;ll lead the
sorrel.&rdquo;&nbsp; He helped his sister mount, and then the
teacher turned her horse toward the farthest side of the cove,
the others following.&nbsp; Martin saw one rider after another
disappear, for the moment, over the edge of the slope as though
they had mysteriously slipped from sight.&nbsp; He went on with a
shamefaced feeling that he was not the one to find shelter for
the little company&mdash;he was older than Abner.&nbsp; But as
well as he knew the caves and passages around Goose Creek, these
were strange to him; he had never once thought of the possibility
of some time needing shelter among them.&nbsp; Although there was
no way to help himself he felt very uncomfortable.&nbsp; He
pulled his hat brim low to shade his eyes&mdash;the snow <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>was coming
faster&mdash;and watched the last of the straggling line that in
spite of his efforts was getting farther and farther away,
winding down around huge boulders and clusters of laurel and
pine.&nbsp; Miss Howard had been the first to vanish, now Talitha
on the submissive Jack was also out of sight.&nbsp; He urged his
reluctant beast forward, several times nearly missing his
footing.</p>
<p>Miss Howard had not been mistaken.&nbsp; As her friends said,
her bump of location was well developed.&nbsp; Just as the dusk
and the storm were closing down upon them, she led her followers
into a narrow passageway between rocky walls, and stopped at the
large, black mouth of a cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; she called back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
are your matches?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to see if the place is
already inhabited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some.&rdquo;&nbsp; Abner sprang to the ground,
handed the mule&rsquo;s rein to Talitha, and came to the
teacher&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel on the ground just inside the cave and find me
some dry twigs or splinters, if you can; we must be careful of
the matches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy fumbled about on his knees for a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here are some and they feel real tinder-y, too.&nbsp; Let
me go ahead.&rdquo;&nbsp; Abner struck a match and applied it
carefully to the pine twigs he had bunched.&nbsp; It made a fine
torch, revealing what at first appeared to be a small cave, but
which gradually widened as <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>they went on to one of considerable
dimensions.</p>
<p>Several times the boy stopped to renew his torch.&nbsp;
Fortunately there was plenty of material&mdash;a litter of pine,
balsam, and fir boughs, as though the place had been recently
occupied.&nbsp; There were no signs of the presence of wild
animals as the young woman had secretly feared, but suddenly
Abner stopped in astonishment.&nbsp; He instantly recognized the
dark object at the farther end of the cave and shivered,
remembering certain events of his boyhood days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only an old still that&rsquo;s been there
for years,&rdquo; reassured Miss Howard, failing to
understand.&nbsp; She slipped from her horse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now we
must have a fire the very first thing.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
place,&rdquo; pointing to what seemed a natural fireplace in the
rocky wall where lay a heap of ashes.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a kind of chimney above it, so we won&rsquo;t be smoked
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a fine bed of coals!&rdquo; Abner
presently exclaimed, uncovering them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fortunate; it&rsquo;ll be such a saving of
matches.&nbsp; I think we can pick up plenty of stuff to make a
good fire, then we must go out and forage for enough to last
through the night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Howard seemed as cheerful
and matter-of-fact as though she were in her own home, while in
reality she was much perplexed at the unmistakable evidences that
the place had, very recently, been inhabited.&nbsp; It was <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>much too
late in the season for surveyors, or parties in search of
botanical or geological specimens.&nbsp; They might have been
hunters lured to the mountains by the unusually pleasant weather
and the prospect of returning with a full game bag.&nbsp; She
tried to think of the latter possibility; at any rate the young
people&rsquo;s suspicions must not be aroused.</p>
<p>In a few moments Abner and Gincy had a brisk fire
burning.&nbsp; Talitha was feeding the horses and mules some corn
she found in the saddlebags.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have a
pretty slim supper, I&rsquo;m afraid, and they&rsquo;re so
hungry&mdash;I wonder why Martin doesn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; she
broke off, looking anxiously toward the entrance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you suppose he could have missed the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think more likely the sorrel is having a hard time to
get along,&rdquo; said her teacher.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if he
isn&rsquo;t here soon Abner and I will go to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glow of the fire lighted the cave, and the young woman
glanced around with apparent carelessness, but her eyes were keen
and watchful.&nbsp; Behind the old still she picked up a
man&rsquo;s coat.&nbsp; It had not lain there long, for it was
only slightly damp and no musty smell clung to it.&nbsp; She
quietly tucked it into a niche of the wall.&nbsp; Over by the
fire the girls were examining the contents of the saddlebags in
an effort to eke out a respectable supper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I
hadn&rsquo;t eaten so much at noon,&rdquo; she heard Gincy
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t need it and I feel <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>just as
hungry as though I hadn&rsquo;t had a bite of breakfast or
dinner, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Howard did not allow herself to think of the consequences
should they find themselves hemmed in by snowdrifts the next
morning, but she was again reminded that Martin had not yet
appeared.&nbsp; Something must be done immediately.&nbsp; She
hurried over to the young people, and with their help two large
torches were made.&nbsp; One was lighted.&nbsp; &ldquo;We may not
need the other, but we&rsquo;ll keep it for an emergency,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay right here and don&rsquo;t worry;
we&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Howard and Abner
hurried out of the cave.</p>
<p>How dark it had grown!&nbsp; The young woman was startled as,
with torch held aloft, she peered out at the end of the
passageway.&nbsp; There were no signs of Martin anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better call to him,&rdquo; she said to
Abner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo! halloo!&rdquo; the lad repeated again and
again, and then they both listened.&nbsp; The echoes died away in
the hollows of the great hills, but no answering call came back
to them.</p>
<h2><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>XIV<br />
LOST ON THE MOUNTAINS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span> saw the last of his party
through a cloud of whirling flakes.&nbsp; He followed as fast as
the lame and now nearly exhausted horse would allow him, but not
a trace of them was again visible.&nbsp; Even the tracks of the
animals were obliterated by the fast falling snow.&nbsp; He did
not lose courage, however, although the trail itself grew fainter
and fainter in the deepening twilight.&nbsp; But finally his
steps grew more halting and doubtful; twice he barely saved
himself from slipping over a rocky ledge.&nbsp; At last he paused
in bewilderment.</p>
<p>Shading his eyes with both hands he looked around.&nbsp; He
could not see two rods before him.&nbsp; Which way should he
go?&nbsp; Where had the little company disappeared?&nbsp; He
hated to call and bring Miss Howard back to show him the
way&mdash;or perhaps she would send Abner.&nbsp; At any rate he
must have help as soon as possible, and lifting up his voice he
shouted with all the strength of his lungs, then waited in vain
for some reply.&nbsp; The old horse whinnied inquiringly and
rubbed his cold nose against <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Martin&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; It
brought the young fellow&rsquo;s grievance to mind afresh.&nbsp;
If his father had not refused to let Talitha ride Cain&mdash;a
biddable young mule&mdash;although there would be no work for the
animal until spring, he would not be in this plight; the whole
party could have made much faster progress and perhaps have
reached the Bradshaw place in spite of the storm.&nbsp; But there
was no time for bitter reflection; he must keep moving.&nbsp;
Evidently his companions were already beyond the sound of his
voice&mdash;call as he might.</p>
<p>In that partially sheltered place he could feel the air
growing colder&mdash;a wind swept through the pines above his
head and sent down light clouds of snow.&nbsp; Martin shivered
helplessly, then in despair made a plunge forward, the sorrel
stumbled after; both slipped&mdash;it was a misstep&mdash;and
went down, down, the young fellow still clinging to the bridle
with one hand while the other caught at bush and sapling to break
his fall.&nbsp; Every moment he expected the horse would descend
upon him.&nbsp; It was so close he could hear its frightened
snorts as it crashed downward.</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s head grew dizzy, a weird light whirled before
him; strange cries echoed in his ears, and he felt numb in a
helpless fright.&nbsp; Then he suddenly stopped with a jolt and
jar that opened his eyes.&nbsp; Still that glow, brighter than
ever, was before them.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>&ldquo;Lands!&rdquo; shouted a voice, &ldquo;be careful
or that critter&rsquo;ll tromp on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the poor boy, he must have slipped over the bank
and the horse after him.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a miracle they were not
killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin tried to speak, but he was too dazed to put the words
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abner, see if he&rsquo;s hurt anywhere.&nbsp; I do hope
there are no bones broken.&nbsp; We shouldn&rsquo;t have let him
get so far behind,&rdquo; Miss Howard was reproaching herself
severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;s stunned more than anything
else,&rdquo; decided Abner wisely, after helping Martin to his
feet and brushing off the snow.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if the sorrel
ain&rsquo;t used up it&rsquo;ll be a wonder.&nbsp; He air too old
fer such servigrous exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the animal floundered about excitedly, his fright was
partly due to the flaming torch which Miss Howard held above her
head.&nbsp; Abner soon quieted the frantic creature.&nbsp; They
were near the passageway leading to the cave and shielded from
the fury of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon as you can, fasten your horse to that pine and
help me get Martin in by the fire; we&rsquo;ll come back after it
shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together, the two helped the young fellow along the
passageway.&nbsp; The torch had suddenly flickered out, but a
pale light showed the entrance to the cave.&nbsp; Two heads were
thrust anxiously out, then the watchers ran to meet them.</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>&ldquo;Is Martin hurt?&rdquo; exclaimed Talitha as she
caught hold of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really think so,&rdquo; assured her
teacher, &ldquo;but he must be chilled through.&nbsp; We must get
him in by the fire&mdash;not too close&mdash;and rub him
well.&nbsp; I wish he had something hot to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gradually Martin came to himself, although he seemed much
exhausted.&nbsp; He lay propped up near the fire, the girls
hovering over him while Miss Howard and Abner again
disappeared.&nbsp; Presently they returned with the sorrel.</p>
<p>Except for numerous bruises and being badly shaken up, the old
horse had escaped injury, but it was plainly evident that he
would not be able to carry Talitha farther on her journey.</p>
<p>None of the party were thinking of that now, they were too
thankful to be together once more.&nbsp; Fortunately the cave was
large enough to allow of the animals being tethered near the
entrance and leave room about the fireplace for their riders to
spread the scanty supper.&nbsp; It was meagre enough, and the
party thought hungrily of the bountiful dinner they had eaten
that noon&mdash;it seemed like yesterday.&nbsp; If the weather
permitted them to go on the next morning there would be several
hours&rsquo; journey before they could get anything more to eat,
and if they were obliged to stay longer&mdash;&nbsp; That was too
serious to think <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>about and they tried to help Miss Howard make as light
of the situation as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saved an ear of corn for the sorrel,&rdquo; whispered
Talitha to Abner.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in Jack&rsquo;s
saddlebag.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was terribly hard to see the faithful
animals nosing about on the ground for a bit of
provender&mdash;much worse than going without herself, Talitha
thought.&nbsp; Abner nodded and slipped away.&nbsp; After a time
he returned with an armful of sticks and threw them down before
the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can easily find enough to last through the night, and
perhaps I can get a little fodder if I look around.&nbsp; It
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be snowing quite so much, but I can hardly
tell, it&rsquo;s so sheltered here,&rdquo; he said, choosing some
dry pine for another torch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to start out foraging I&rsquo;m going
with you,&rdquo; Miss Howard declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want any more people getting lost.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure that
Martin wouldn&rsquo;t care to repeat his experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young fellow shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
all right come morning, though,&rdquo; he announced
confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go along and help Abner, then we can get all
that is needed in two or three trips,&rdquo; begged Gincy.</p>
<p>The young woman hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but
it might be a good plan,&rdquo; she answered finally.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But Martin must stay right where he is and try to get
rested.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>Miss
Howard halted at the entrance to the passageway, holding the
torch aloft and keeping a sharp eye on her charges.&nbsp; She
might have been Liberty enlightening the mountains as she stood
there&mdash;the light flaming out over the white slopes
beyond.&nbsp; The snow was still falling upon them, but in more
scattering flakes as though the storm had spent its force.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she saw&mdash;with a start&mdash;little gleams of
light flash far upon the opposite mountain-side.&nbsp; They
vanished and again appeared in another place as though
people&mdash;there were certainly more than one&mdash;were moving
about.&nbsp; She thought of the coat she had found in the cave,
and her old anxiety returned.&nbsp; Talitha and Gincy coming
up&mdash;their arms heaped with firewood&mdash;wondered at her
pale face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;re plumb tuckered out,&rdquo; said
the latter sympathizingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;My, what a pile
Abner&rsquo;s got!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you &rsquo;low it&rsquo;ll
do us to-night if we&rsquo;re careful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher surveyed it with doubt, but she only said calmly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it will last a long time, and if we should
need any more it can be easily gathered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only had a hatchet I could get some big sticks
down in that holler,&rdquo; panted Abner.&nbsp; &ldquo;I picked
up a little green stuff for the beastes to nibble at, it&rsquo;ll
make &rsquo;em more content, but it&rsquo;s mighty poor
feedin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering the cave they found Martin asleep <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>by the
fire.&nbsp; Quietly they moved about, making themselves
comfortable as possible for the night and were soon dozing around
the fireplace.</p>
<p>Miss Howard did not allow her eyes to close.&nbsp; She watched
and listened, alert to catch any unusual sound, while the young
people around her slept fitfully.</p>
<p>Late in the night she heard voices, then a wild shout and the
crunching of hoofs in the snow.&nbsp; The mules did not stir, but
the horses became restless and one of them whinnied.&nbsp; The
sleepers awoke suddenly and sat up.&nbsp; Miss Howard looked at
her watch, it was nearly twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; She smiled
at them sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to sing something?&rdquo; she
inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps the night won&rsquo;t seem so long
if we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha rubbed her eyes.&nbsp; It was a strange request at
that late hour and in such a place, but she cheerfully joined in
with the others when her teacher began the old choral so familiar
to Bentville pupils:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A mighty fortress is our God,<br />
A bulwark never failing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strong, young voices filled the cave with strange echoes
which penetrated into the night.&nbsp; The singers caught the
spirit of the song as they went on and on.&nbsp; All their fears
for the morrow had vanished.&nbsp; The dumb creatures looked
around at them in astonishment.</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Miss
Howard was keeping her eyes on the entrance as she sang.&nbsp;
Over the animals&rsquo; heads she could see a light coming along
the passageway.&nbsp; It grew brighter and brighter as it neared
the cave opening.&nbsp; Her charges did not see it; Martin was
singing with closed eyes, and the two girls were watching Abner
pile fresh sticks upon the fire.&nbsp; She knew how superstitious
were the mountain people, especially the lawless ones who were
fugitives from justice because of their propensity for
appropriating their neighbours&rsquo; horses and cattle.&nbsp;
Was it possible that after all her little party was to be
molested?</p>
<p>As the last note died away, a man&rsquo;s head, covered with a
coonskin cap, was thrust inside and then as suddenly
withdrawn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on, Joe, Gid, here they are safe and
sound!&rdquo; shouted a bluff voice, and the
Bradshaws&mdash;father and sons&mdash;hurried into the cave.</p>
<p>With delighted shouts the wayfarers gathered around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been beatin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout these here
mountings sence nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said the older man,
&ldquo;and we war jest ready ter give up when we heard the
singin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Hit war powerful deceivin&rsquo; at
first&mdash;a-comin&rsquo; up out&rsquo;n the ground that-away,
till I &rsquo;lowed you war nowhar but in that old still
cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was the light from your lanterns I saw when the
young people were gathering the firewood.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you
see my torch?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Joe
Bradshaw laughed while his father and brother looked
sheepish.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, we did see it, but Pappy and Gid
&rsquo;lowed it was a harnt.&nbsp; At first it looked like a fire
from where we were, and then it disappeared so suddenly it really
was mystifying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the singin&rsquo; thet fetched us,&rdquo;
persisted the elder Bradshaw.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;d been
expectin&rsquo; you sence before sundown, and when hit went on
nine o&rsquo;clock and war dark and snowy I &rsquo;lowed you war
lost and we jest set out ter sarch.&nbsp; Thar war a passel
o&rsquo; hoss thieves in these parts a leetle spell back, and we
&rsquo;lowed, too, thet mebbe they&rsquo;d got a holt of your
beastes and left you ter foot hit.&nbsp; Thet&rsquo;s the reason
we didn&rsquo;t sarch here fust thing.&nbsp; This has been the
place ter find sech as them, and we warn&rsquo;t nowise anxious
ter make their &rsquo;quaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gid has some corn in the saddlebags for the
beastes,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;and I have something for your
supper that mother sent.&nbsp; You must be nearly
starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Talitha agreed with her teacher that it would be better to
wait until morning and have a hearty meal before continuing their
journey.&nbsp; Relieved of the necessity for watchfulness, Miss
Howard was soon asleep.&nbsp; After talking a little longer her
charges followed suit while the Bradshaws kept careful guard.</p>
<p>It was later than usual when the little company breakfasted
the next morning.&nbsp; There <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>was no finer cook in all the
mountains than Mrs. Bradshaw.&nbsp; A large loaf of light bread
and a bag of crullers were a welcome addition to the potatoes Joe
had put roasting in the ashes at an early hour, and the bacon,
eggs, and coffee served in true camp fashion.&nbsp; As they ate
they could hear the melting snow dripping from the rocks.&nbsp;
The sun was shining and sent splashes of light into the
passageway.&nbsp; They could not be otherwise than merry,
although they listened with a shiver to Martin&rsquo;s account of
his experience the previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed as though I slipped miles&mdash;that I should
never get to the foot of this awful mountain.&nbsp; And I could
hear the old sorrel tearing along after me.&nbsp; Every minute I
expected he&rsquo;d land on top and I&rsquo;d be crushed to a
pulp&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Abner chimed in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The old beastie is sure &rsquo;nough game.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve seen him slide down into the holler from Red Mountain
when it was icy, and he just put his legs together stiff and
slipped along as slick as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better ride my hoss critter the rest of the
way,&rdquo; Gid offered with true mountain hospitality.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lead the sorrel home and keep him &rsquo;til
he&rsquo;s called fer&mdash;thar&rsquo;s &rsquo;nough stable
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha felt as grateful for this proposal as Abner and Gincy
could possibly have done, for she knew the animal would have the
best <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>of
care and a long rest.&nbsp; Dan Gooch would not be able to come
for him until spring opened.</p>
<p>Before leaving the cave Miss Howard brought out the coat she
had tucked away.&nbsp; The elder Bradshaw examined it closely,
while the others watched his face, which wore a mysterious
expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d best pack hit &rsquo;long with
me,&rdquo; he said presently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I might happen on the
owner; I reckon he war in haste ter git away or he&rsquo;d never
left sech as this behind in the ol&rsquo; still cave.&nbsp; I
call hit downright onlucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew before there was a still in these
parts,&rdquo; said Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought it was over by
Pigg Branch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you&rsquo;ll find one thar now if you&rsquo;ll
take the resk of sarchin&rsquo; fer hit, but this here one war
put out o&rsquo; business a cornsiderable spell
back.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man chuckled with such evident amusement
that all but Miss Howard and his two sons stared in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better tell them,&rdquo; urged the
former, &ldquo;it is a very interesting story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mam war sure &rsquo;nough peart,&rdquo; grinned the
old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lish Dumley kep&rsquo; this still when I
war &rsquo;bout Joe&rsquo;s age, and pap and I uster come up and
call on him oftener&rsquo;n war fer our good.&nbsp; Hit made mam
mighty sober-sided, but we never paid no &rsquo;tention ter
anythin&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; One day she tuk hit inter her head
ter go ter the Gap ter see Lizy <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Sneed-they war gals
tergether&mdash;and left pappy and me ter tend the young-uns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night this ol&rsquo; still war raided and Lish
Dumley and his men caught red-handed.&nbsp; Hit&rsquo;s the last
they seen of the mountings fer many a year, &rsquo;cept mebbe
what they could view through the bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;low your mammy was mightily pleasured to have
the stillin&rsquo; stopped,&rdquo; said Gincy innocently.</p>
<p>Mr. Bradshaw smiled broadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Law, yes.&nbsp; When
mam undertook a thing hit war good as done.&nbsp; She never said
nothin&rsquo; ter nobody, but the sheriff let hit leak out; he
war thet pleased mam war so gritty.&nbsp; Pappy &rsquo;lowed
Dumley&rsquo;d burn our cabin once he got out&rsquo;n the pen,
but I reckon he war too broken-sperited ter take revenge
thet&rsquo;d only shut him up agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;low our mammy&rsquo;d do the same thing if
thet still war a-runnin&rsquo; now,&rdquo; said Gid
proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She air mighty servigrous when hit comes
ter whiskey and sech, and pappy air jest as set agin hit,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little party looked with a new interest around the cave,
and at the dark silent object which the sheriff and his men had
wrecked that it do no more harm.&nbsp; If it only had a voice how
many strange tales it could tell them.</p>
<p>Out on the trail once more with the sun shining above their
heads, they made more rapid progress than the day previous.&nbsp;
Gid <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>was
far in the rear leading the sorrel.&nbsp; Not more than a quarter
of a mile from the cave, Mr. Bradshaw, who was ahead, stopped
suddenly.&nbsp; As the rest of the party came up he pointed into
a sheltered hollow shut in by rocky walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See whar those fellers stopped last night.&nbsp;
Hit&rsquo;s a wonder they didn&rsquo;t rout you out of thet cave
and take your beastes.&rdquo;&nbsp; A heap of ashes and the much
trodden earth showed where the desperadoes had camped.&nbsp;
Gincy and Talitha were pale with fright.&nbsp; How near they had
been to danger after all!</p>
<p>Because of their late start, the party did not reach the
Bradshaw home until nearly noon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;lowed you&rsquo;d come,&rdquo; Mrs. Bradshaw
declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;The boys and their pappy generally gits
what they go after.&nbsp; Only I reckoned they might hev fetched
along a couple or so of them hoss thieves, the sheriff and his
men hev been a-sarchin&rsquo; fer, seein&rsquo; thar war sech a
comp&rsquo;ny of you,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hev found whar they war last night,&rdquo; exclaimed
Pappy Bradshaw triumphantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I hev
somethin&rsquo; ter remember the leader of the gang.&nbsp; He may
be a-callin&rsquo; fer hit some day.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man
chuckled loudly to himself, but Miss Howard instantly changed the
subject.</p>
<p>In good season the next morning the party were once more on
their way and reached Bentville early that evening.</p>
<h2><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>XV<br />
THE WALKING PARTY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Spring</span> came on apace.&nbsp; There
was a lingering perfume from the apple blossoms in the air when
Lalla proposed a walking party.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to
the Crater, have our supper, and come back by moonlight.&nbsp;
Miss Howard&rsquo;s going with us&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it
grand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; said Gincy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon Miss
Howard&rsquo;s planning to let some one else inspect the rooms
and hall this afternoon; she knows I can&rsquo;t squeeze in
another thing and go.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m worn out already trying to
plan for my work, and lessons, and music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all arranged,&rdquo; said Lalla,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re to start promptly from the front steps at two
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll help you put away the towels;
I&rsquo;m all ready this minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy looked at Lalla&rsquo;s short, brown skirt and percale
waist as she was counting the sheets.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
she said at last, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve a thing
to wear&mdash;climbing&rsquo;s terribly hard on
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve another old skirt you&rsquo;re welcome to;
it&rsquo;s a fright, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her along, I&rsquo;ll be plumb tickled to improve
her looks,&rdquo; agreed Gincy gaily.</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>Lalla
ran off and soon reappeared with a bright homespun.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wore for the first three months.&nbsp;
I thought it was pretty then; I never saw such a thing to wear,
you can&rsquo;t tear it to save your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a regular beacon light, we won&rsquo;t
need the moon coming back,&rdquo; said Gincy as she flew around
to finish her morning&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put a
twist of red ribbon around Abner&rsquo;s old hat.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve a piece that&rsquo;s almost a match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the four girls gathered on the front porch of the Hall,
there sat Miss Howard with her folding easel and box of
paints.&nbsp; &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;suppose we
change our minds and go to Slate Lick this afternoon, then I can
do some sketching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Gincy delightedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been out that way at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty pretty, and not so hard
walking,&rdquo; said Kizzie, and the rest seemed equally pleased
with the change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down Scafflecane Pike and cut across to
the railroad, it&rsquo;s a good deal shorter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss
Howard gathered up her belongings and started off ahead at a
brisk pace.&nbsp; At the gate they met Mallie and Nancy Jane, the
latter had been crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask them to go with us,&rdquo; said Miss
Howard, turning suddenly.&nbsp; There was a brief consultation
behind the cypresses, then Lalla sped back after the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them to come just as they are!&rdquo; <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>called
Urilla.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank goodness, they aren&rsquo;t dressed
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a queer looking bundle,&rdquo; remarked Mallie as
the two joined the waiting group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; responded Gincy, patting a bulky
parcel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shooting irons come handy whar thar air
dangerous animals,&rdquo; relapsing into her former
vocabulary.</p>
<p>Nancy Jane brightened visibly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
some one feels funny; I&rsquo;ve been too homesick for anything
all day.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t had a letter this week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get one on the evening mail,&rdquo; Gincy
assured her.&nbsp; &ldquo;No news, good news.&nbsp; I belong to
the Don&rsquo;t Worry Club; you&rsquo;d better join.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to scratch around
and find out about a lot of new birds before I see Professor
Lewis again.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know any, for sure, except
robins and buzzards.&nbsp; This will be a good time to get
information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general laugh in which Nancy Jane joined, her
sorrows for the moment occupying the background.&nbsp; They filed
down the long, straight road and crossed Silver Creek.&nbsp;
There was a substantial bridge&mdash;built for high
water&mdash;but Lalla and Mallie preferred the rickety
foot-bridge farther down which trembled at every slight bit of
weight imposed upon it.&nbsp; Miss Howard watched rather
anxiously, but was soon reassured.&nbsp; They reached the farther
end safely and started off across the fields toward the
railroad.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>The
foothills seemed a vast, undulating semicircle.&nbsp; One bold
knob higher than the rest, with precipitous sides patched with
pines, stood out with more importance; but it lacked their
allurement of tender colouring.</p>
<p>Straight into the heart of the range, the railroad cut its
way, and a long, creeping freight train trailed by just as they
turned to follow the track.&nbsp; A shower of cinders deluged
Mallie and Lalla; they wheeled and walked backward until Gincy
and Kizzie caught up.&nbsp; Nancy Jane panted close behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a monster in my eye!&rdquo; moaned
Mallie, plucking at the offender.&nbsp; Her efforts were vain,
and each girl, in turn, was rewarded in the same way.&nbsp;
Urilla and Miss Howard, far in the rear, were talking too
earnestly to make much progress, or notice the group ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad your mother&rsquo;s better,&rdquo;
the teacher was saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know you want to stay, and
we can&rsquo;t spare such girls as you very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urilla&rsquo;s face beamed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Miss Howard, do
you really mean it?&nbsp; I feel that I&rsquo;m improving, I was
so stupid at first&mdash;now I can see through things
better.&nbsp; Gincy&rsquo;s helped me, she&rsquo;s always saying
something nice and encouraging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gincy&rsquo;s a treasure!&rdquo; said Miss Howard
warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But where are the girls, they were on the
track a minute ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another train thundered by.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish they <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>wouldn&rsquo;t keep so far ahead, that&rsquo;s the
3:15, and it goes like lightning when it&rsquo;s making up
time,&rdquo; Urilla remarked uneasily.</p>
<p>They hurried along, scanning each clump of bushes and stack of
grain, but no one was visible.&nbsp; &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t
have gone in here!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Howard, looking at a
little weather beaten cabin very near the track.&nbsp; Then she
listened.&nbsp; Yes, there were voices that sounded
familiar.&nbsp; Through the half-open door, the two caught
glimpses of Gincy&rsquo;s bright skirt and gay hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what they&rsquo;re doing, and why we
didn&rsquo;t see them when they turned off the track,&rdquo; said
Urilla as they opened a rickety gate and went into the
yard.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a dreadful place to live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Howard agreed as she looked at the forlorn and desolate
little cabin with not one home-like feature; even the yard was
bare and wind-swept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s Talitha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp; The two pushed up eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Donnelly told me this morning she had gone to see
some of her kinfolk, but I didn&rsquo;t know they lived
here,&rdquo; said Urilla, looking curiously at the bare little
cabin.</p>
<p>Standing just inside the door, the missing girls were talking
to Talitha, who, with her dress pinned up around her and a towel
over her head, was busy cleaning.&nbsp; Three small children
played near the fireplace, and beyond, <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>propped
upon an old pillow, her bright eyes watching the newcomer, was
the tiniest woman they had ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had measles?&rdquo; asked Talitha, waving her
broom at them.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t, stay
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Urilla scornfully,
&ldquo;years ago; but I don&rsquo;t see any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another wave directed them to a small bed near a darkened
window.&nbsp; Two flushed faces peered above a ragged quilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; gasped Urilla, taking in the
situation.&nbsp; &ldquo;But how did you know?&nbsp; I
thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Howard suddenly interrupted with, &ldquo;This must be
Mrs. Gantley.&nbsp; I intended to find you yesterday, but I
thought you lived on the Big Hill pike.&nbsp; Are you feeling
better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little woman shifted her position slightly, a shadow of a
smile flitting across her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, since Tally
came I&rsquo;m easier in my mind.&nbsp; The children ain&rsquo;t
bad sick&mdash;jest feverish and powerful troublesome; I
couldn&rsquo;t keep &rsquo;em from ketchin&rsquo; cold no way,
out o&rsquo; bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy and Talitha were having a quiet conference in another
part of the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;I found out this morning that
she&rsquo;s kin on mother&rsquo;s side&mdash;way back,&rdquo;
said the latter in a low voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;They used to live in
Cowbell Hollow, but he ran away and left them a month
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha looked unutterable things as she <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>referred to
the recreant Mr. Gantley.&nbsp; Accustomed as she was to the
delinquencies of the mountain men, the desertion of a helpless
family seemed the blackest of crimes.&nbsp; She glanced meaningly
in the direction of a large basket in the corner, and whispered,
&ldquo;They were almost starving.&nbsp; Martin helped me or I
couldn&rsquo;t have got it here&mdash;Mrs. Donnelly gave me so
many things, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said Gincy, slipping an arm around
Talitha&rsquo;s waist, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay and help; I
can go for a walk any Saturday.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll scrub the
children, gather wood, and cook.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t it be
fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want to?&rdquo; asked Talitha, her
tired face brightening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; the rest can trot along just the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; grumbled Lalla as they proceeded
without Gincy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get hold of that
man.&nbsp; Do you know anything about the family, Miss
Howard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, only he&rsquo;s fond of moonshine.&nbsp; He
sold the home about three weeks ago&mdash;told her he was getting
ready to come to Bentville, where there was a good school for the
children.&nbsp; When she found that he had really gone, she
thought he might be here and followed him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss
Howard walked on with her head held high; she did not want the
girls to read in her face the fulness of disgust which she felt
for a man of that type.&nbsp; There were <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>others like
him whose sons and daughters were working their way through
school, trying to redeem the family name and become worthy
citizens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; said Mallie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They ought to catch him and make him work good and
hard&mdash;beat him if he didn&rsquo;t&mdash;and give all his
wages to his folks.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d teach him to run away from
those pretty children, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a chair in the house,&rdquo;
interrupted Nancy Jane, &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t see a
dish.&nbsp; That poor woman might just as well chase a Bushy
tail; she&rsquo;ll never see him again&mdash;not until the
children grow up, then he&rsquo;ll come back and live on
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to get rid of him,&rdquo; said Urilla
conclusively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen men like that
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment, and the group became more
widely scattered.&nbsp; Lalla forged straight ahead until she was
several rods in advance.&nbsp; She scanned the great slate
boulders on either side and listened.&nbsp; There were voices,
familiar ones, then all was quiet.&nbsp; Everywhere the foothills
hemmed them in.&nbsp; Suddenly a rock crashed in front of
her.&nbsp; Looking up she saw Abner&rsquo;s shock of light hair
as, flat on his stomach, he peered over the edge of the
cliff.&nbsp; The head disappeared and an improvised mask took its
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; commanded a muffled voice which closely
resembled Martin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Lalla threw up <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>her hands
in mock fright.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come around behind that pine tree,
we&rsquo;re laying for some of our crowd.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
something in the wind to-day, for Raphael Sloan and Joe Bradshaw
sneaked off without letting us know&mdash;dropped out all of a
sudden.&nbsp; Keep your eye peeled for them, won&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; Likely they&rsquo;re up at the springs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the rest know we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo;
warned Abner, peering over Martin&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;it
might spoil the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; agreed Lalla with her old love for
a joke.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go ahead and have your fun; but what if they
go back the other way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Think up some
scheme; you can do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both heads disappeared as
Nancy Jane&rsquo;s voice was borne to them from below.</p>
<p>Lalla picked a few violets and walked on carelessly, looking
up at the mountains on the opposite side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurry up
or we&rsquo;ll never get there!&rdquo; she called back, waving
her flowers; &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be heaps of these at Slate
Lick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gorge widened.&nbsp; A trickling, shallow stream crept
through the bed.&nbsp; The foothills seemed suddenly to have
become mountains and surrounded them, making a basin-like
valley.&nbsp; On the opposite side, sheltered by walnuts, stood a
few deserted houses and a building which seemed halfway between a
store and a peanut stand.</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s quite a colony here in
summer,&rdquo; said Miss Howard, when at last they stood in front
of the spring house and fitted the long key into the
padlock.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sulphur water calls them, and the
view.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it beautiful!&nbsp; I want to get the
Knob painted in while the haze is over it.&nbsp; You young folks
run along and do your climbing; I&rsquo;ll whistle for you when
it&rsquo;s time to go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Talitha and Gincy were only here!&rdquo; sighed
Kizzie after the first long climb.&nbsp; Together they stood
panting for breath and watched the scene below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Lalla?&nbsp; She beats everything for
disappearing right before one&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; Nancy Jane
frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t lose her though, that&rsquo;s the beauty
of it,&rdquo; remarked Urilla as they looked around behind the
trees and boulders.&nbsp; Below, Miss Howard sat intent upon her
canvas.&nbsp; A tinkling cowbell was the only sound which greeted
their ears.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for going on.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
one of Lalla&rsquo;s tricks; she&rsquo;s a good deal nearer than
we think&mdash;probably laughing at us this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lalla, when she dropped behind the rest, had taken a trail
leading off to the left.&nbsp; She was sure that it came back to
the main trail again, and it would give her a splendid
opportunity to pop out and surprise them.&nbsp; She soon found
that it led around an immense boulder, that it was steep, and
grew steeper.&nbsp; <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>As she paused quite breathless, the
sound of men&rsquo;s voices came from behind the rock.</p>
<p>A clump of small evergreens made a convenient hiding-place;
behind them Lalla listened.&nbsp; She was not in the least
alarmed, only curious.&nbsp; The voices grew louder, one of them
seemed to be chanting or reciting something; it was hard to tell
which.&nbsp; Lalla stole out a little farther and crouched close
to the rock, listening breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louder, Raf, so I can hear you at this
distance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lalla fancied she could have touched Joe
Bradshaw had not the rock projected a thin edge between
them.&nbsp; She sank noiselessly into a bed of tall ferns.&nbsp;
So here were the truants!&nbsp; Martin and Abner should hear
about them; she would jump out and give Joe the scare of his
life.</p>
<p>On and on went the voices, the nearer one correcting and
halting the speaker from time to time.</p>
<p>Lalla listened intently; her eyes grew larger.&nbsp; What was
Raphael saying!&nbsp; She sat perfectly rigid as the truth
flashed upon her.&nbsp; It was his speech for the Mountain
Congress, and he was to speak against Abner.&nbsp; No wonder they
stole away from the boys.</p>
<p>For some minutes Lalla sat undecided.&nbsp; Raphael Sloan was
a formidable opponent, and Abner new at the business of
debating.&nbsp; If she could only give the latter a
hint&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t tell right out.&nbsp; How proud
Gincy <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>would be to have her brother win the debate.&nbsp; Her
heart beat fast and she listened as she had never listened
before; not a word must be lost and she must not be discovered
now for the world!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be ready for the rebuttal;
they&rsquo;ll get you on that point&mdash;Abner&rsquo;s working
like a tiger.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then there was an audible movement
on the other side of the boulder which made Lalla&rsquo;s heart
beat like a trip-hammer.&nbsp; To her infinite relief, Raphael
Sloan moved on up the trail and Joe after him.&nbsp; She could
hear their voices growing fainter and fainter each moment.</p>
<p>Cautiously she slipped from her hiding-place and retraced her
steps to a point lower down.&nbsp; There was a way to cut across
the other trail, but it was through blackberry bushes, wild
grapevines, and a tangle of underbrush.&nbsp; Lalla did not
hesitate, however; slipping and sliding, she fairly rushed
forward, not stopping for scratches nor even bruises.&nbsp; From
the thicket she suddenly emerged into a small
opening&mdash;hardly a clearing&mdash;in which was a tiny shack
of logs.&nbsp; To all appearances it was deserted, but Lalla
decided to avoid it and come out just beyond.&nbsp; A gun sounded
very near; a hound bayed.&nbsp; She shrank back where the shadows
were deep, and silently threaded her way in the direction of the
old trail.&nbsp; It could not be many rods farther on.</p>
<p>For fully a half-hour she stumbled along, <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>then she
heard Nancy Jane&rsquo;s voice, and the girls fell on her with
loud reproaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was exploring,&rdquo; Lalla said with shining eyes,
and then she told them about the cabin.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
mighty secret; I&rsquo;d never found it only for taking the short
cut.&nbsp; Folks could do stillin&rsquo; and no one be the
wiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they do make moonshine there,&rdquo; said
Mallie after a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;We heard that shot and were
worrying about you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you run away
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalla smiled, but did not answer.</p>
<p>A long whistle came from below.&nbsp; It was repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Miss Howard!&rdquo; exclaimed Kizzie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She wants us right away; see how late it&rsquo;s
getting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the way down Lalla was very quiet.&nbsp; Her head was full
of plans to help Abner and find out more about the mysterious
cabin.&nbsp; Mystery appealed to her vivid imagination and
stimulated her to immediate action.</p>
<p>A thin trail of smoke came up to them as they made the last
steep descent into the basin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Lalla, Miss
Howard&rsquo;s getting supper and I&rsquo;m so hungry,&rdquo;
said Kizzie.&nbsp; But Lalla was thinking of the two
boys&mdash;which way could they have gone home?</p>
<h2><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>XVI<br />
THE MOUNTAIN CONGRESS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was several days before Lalla
saw Abner alone.&nbsp; He was certainly working like a
tiger.&nbsp; He rushed over to meals, and when the boys were
dismissed, was gone like a shot, not waiting to join the groups
who visited in the yard.</p>
<p>It wanted a week of the Mountain Congress when she followed
him into the library one day and straight back to the stack
room.&nbsp; There was a long table in one corner and piles of
reference books on it.&nbsp; Abner had snatched his cap off and
was digging for the bottom one of the nearest pile when Lalla
touched his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working on your debate?&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abner looked up gratefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reckon
on it much&mdash;Raphael&rsquo;s an old hand, they tell
me&mdash;but I&rsquo;m learnin&rsquo; a lot, that&rsquo;s one
sure thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of some points which will be likely
to help you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lalla pushed a sheet his way.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can never tell what they&rsquo;re going to spring on
you just at the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Abner
took it with a look of surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
that you even knew the subject of the debate; we&rsquo;ve tried
to keep it a secret.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lalla reddened&mdash;she had
not thought of this emergency.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course I told
Gincy,&rdquo; Abner continued, &ldquo;and I know she trusts you,
so it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had misconstrued her evident embarrassment, and was trying
to reassure her.&nbsp; For one moment Lalla&rsquo;s courage
failed, but she was sure Abner stood little chance of winning
without some help, and there was almost no risk of discovery, not
even if Gincy told her brother that she had kept the secret.</p>
<p>Lalla&rsquo;s impetuous nature was capable of a good deal of
self-sacrifice&mdash;mistaken at times, but nevertheless genuine
in motive.&nbsp; She had a warm feeling of gratitude toward the
girl who had not, by even so much as a look, hinted at her
adventures with the master key.&nbsp; Indeed, Lalla felt that
Gincy had entire confidence in her assurance that she would be
perfectly straightforward from that time on.</p>
<p>It was the mountain warfare over again, and Lalla did not feel
any real compunction about the methods.&nbsp; She knew
instinctively, however, that Gincy and Abner would look at it
differently and was prepared for questions.</p>
<p>However, they did not come.&nbsp; &ldquo;These seem like dandy
points; they might do me a heap of good when it comes to the
final touchdown.&rdquo;&nbsp; Abner showed her the result of his
<a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>digging
for the last few weeks&mdash;a whole tablet full of notes,
disorderly enough but right to the point.</p>
<p>Lalla glanced over them with a shrewd eye, and nodded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Abner, they&rsquo;re splendid!&nbsp; But won&rsquo;t you
be scared half to death in front of that crowd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head resolutely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
bluff it if I am; it doesn&rsquo;t do to show one&rsquo;s
feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and Goose Creek folks aren&rsquo;t the scary
kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet they aren&rsquo;t&mdash;not the girls,
anyhow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Abner spoke with conviction.</p>
<p>Devotional exercises the next morning were brief.&nbsp; Then
the excitement began.&nbsp; Banners went up all over the chapel,
and nominations were made for governor of Appalachian
America.&nbsp; There were speeches and special music to arouse
enthusiasm for the Mountain Congress.</p>
<p>The girls from Clay sat in the gallery&mdash;a row of bright
faces keenly watching every movement below to see what counties
were represented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Pike, and Letcher, and Magoffin!&rdquo;
whispered Gincy excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Floyd, and Knott, and Breathitt!&rdquo; added
Talitha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perry, Harlan, Leslie, and&mdash;Oh, look at
Clay!&nbsp; Goody!&nbsp; Goody!&rdquo; Mallie almost lost her
balance and fell into the crowd below.&nbsp; <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>Nancy Jane
pulled her back and kept a firm grip on the excited girl for some
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully interesting!&rdquo; sighed Lalla,
her eyes growing bigger as she watched the platform.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I suppose the congress itself will be twice as
exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were funny speeches from the candidates, each vying with
the other in promising favour to his particular section of the
country.&nbsp; The applause was frequent, and the college band
played &ldquo;Dixie.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every one filed out full of
enthusiasm; they would know the result of the election by
evening.</p>
<p>Lalla and Gincy walked over to Memorial Hall behind Abner and
Martin.&nbsp; There was a grand rally out in
front&mdash;practising yells and singing class songs.&nbsp; The
noise was deafening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saving my voice until Friday night,&rdquo;
Lalla told Abner in the first lull.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
you&rsquo;re going to beat and then you&rsquo;ll hear me
yell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy smiled happily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Abner&rsquo;s going to do
his best; that&rsquo;s the main thing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m proud to
think he&rsquo;s even got a chance to do it, without his
beating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s an honour to have the
chance,&rdquo; said Lalla, &ldquo;but, Gincy, just think how
proud Goose Creek will be to have Abner come home with the
medal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of himself Abner flushed with pleased
anticipation.&nbsp; He was making the fight of his life for a
public honour and did not <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>intend to be beaten.&nbsp; Every
word of his speech was photographed upon his brain, ready for
instant use, if&mdash;and here was the hard part&mdash;if his
opponent did not think of some entirely new line of argument.</p>
<p>Friday evening found the Hall alive with excitement.&nbsp; The
girls were divided into factions.&nbsp; Raphael Sloan was the
best debater Bentville had had for some time, and while Abner was
popular, he was too new to inspire general confidence.&nbsp;
Nearly everybody&mdash;except the Goose Creek folks&mdash;was
sure of the boy who had never been defeated.</p>
<p>The chapel was in an uproar when the girls arrived.&nbsp;
Occupying the centre and front were delegates from each county to
the Mountain Congress.&nbsp; Class colours were everywhere in
evidence.&nbsp; Pennants were fluttering, and yell after yell
went up when the Governor of Appalachian America&mdash;one of the
senior boys&mdash;took his seat on the platform.</p>
<p>Afterwards the whole thing seemed like a dream to Lalla.&nbsp;
Raphael, tall, dark-eyed, with the flush of anticipated victory
on his face.&nbsp; Abner, intense, pale at first and somewhat
hesitating, but warming up with fiery eloquence toward the last
and meeting every argument with growing confidence.</p>
<p>Not once did he fail in the rebuttal, nor even hesitate, and
Lalla saw an amazed look creep over Joe Bradshaw&rsquo;s face as
Abner answered with a glibness born of knowledge, <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>sweeping
the very foundation from under his opponent&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>There could be but one verdict, and the Goose Creek girls saw
Abner hoisted upon strong, young shoulders and borne in triumph
around the room.&nbsp; Once more the pennants waved and
pandemonium broke loose.&nbsp; This time they joined in the
yells.&nbsp; Lalla, in the centre of the circle of girls, never
stopped until her voice gave out.</p>
<p>Joe Bradshaw took his roommate&rsquo;s defeat quite
philosophically.&nbsp; He was fond of Abner and Martin, but
somewhat puzzled at the former&rsquo;s quick replies to every
argument.&nbsp; &ldquo;You did splendidly!&rdquo; he said,
wringing Abner&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Clay County is right to
the front to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abner gave Lalla a quick glance of gratitude.&nbsp; She was
watching him as he talked to Joe and the surrounding boys, not
forgetting to wave at the home girls who found it impossible to
reach him.&nbsp; Gincy&rsquo;s eyes were full of
tears&mdash;proud ones.&nbsp; If her father and mother could only
have been here to see Abner beat the best debater in all the
mountain counties.&nbsp; It would have rewarded them for every
sacrifice.</p>
<p>There was to be a spread in the Industrial Building for the
winner.&nbsp; Talitha and Martin held frequent conferences all
the next day, and by four o&rsquo;clock a constant procession of
boys and girls were busy carrying parcels, <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>bunting,
and branches of pine for decoration, and making the rooms of the
Agricultural Department attractive for the evening crowd.&nbsp;
It was to be a great event for the Goose Creek folks, and they
had prepared accordingly.&nbsp; Pete Shackley guarded the
chickens.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew Abner&rsquo;d beat, those roosters
have been crowing under my bed for two nights.&nbsp; I toted the
box into my room the minute I bought them; there&rsquo;s no
telling where they&rsquo;d be to-day if I
hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy and Mallie kept the door of Number 4 securely locked,
but that precaution did not prevent savoury odours from escaping
which the boys sniffed eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cake!&rdquo; exclaimed Martin delightedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tally said Miss Browning was going to let them use the
cooking room all day.&nbsp; I smell fruit cookies, too.&nbsp; My,
but it&rsquo;s going to be a spread!&nbsp; I wonder what Piny
Twilliger&rsquo;s doing &rsquo;round here; she likes good eating,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but didn&rsquo;t you know she&rsquo;s
Abner&rsquo;s cousin from Redbird?&rdquo; and Isaac Shackley
grasped a big pot of ferns and moved on, leaving Martin staring
in astonishment.</p>
<p>Piny was so tall and snappy and altogether loud&mdash;such a
contrast to Gincy&mdash;Martin had taken a special dislike to her
the very first time she came to Harmonia.&nbsp; That was at the
opening of the spring term and now it was getting pretty well
along toward <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>Commencement.&nbsp; But the girl&rsquo;s voice did not
seem to improve&mdash;it was still coarse and
penetrating&mdash;she wore the gayest colours, and Martin
couldn&rsquo;t enumerate all the reasons why he disliked her, but
he did.</p>
<p>It was growing dusk when everything was ready for the
spread.&nbsp; They were to serve it in the Domestic Science room
at eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Nancy Jane had the key and was
instructed to remain in charge until the ice cream arrived, then
hurry over to the Hall to dress.&nbsp; Nancy Jane turned on the
lights and surveyed the room with satisfaction; there was a good
deal to show for all their work.&nbsp; The cake was delicious,
the chicken fried to a turn.&nbsp; There were great plates of
rolls and plenty of pickles.&nbsp; The long table down the centre
of the room was decorated with Abner&rsquo;s class colours, while
all around, in festoons, were the orange and black of the
Mountain Society&mdash;the first typifying the brilliant autumn
colouring of the hills; the second, the wealth of coal found in
their mines.</p>
<p>The building was far from deserted.&nbsp; There was a clatter
of feet up and down the bare stairs&mdash;fully a dozen boys
roomed on the third floor&mdash;and Nancy Jane locked the door to
secure herself from unceremonious callers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d like to play some game on us&mdash;those
seniors,&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re pretty
sore because a new pupil carried off the honours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was seven o&rsquo;clock, but the cream had not <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>come, and
Nancy Jane was in a quandary.&nbsp; Some one rattled the door
knob.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piny, Piny Twilliger.&nbsp; Let me in; I&rsquo;ve come
to take your place and let you get dressed.&nbsp; Martin had a
message that the cream wouldn&rsquo;t be here for half an hour
yet.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t another soul ready, so Gincy asked
me to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy Jane unlocked the door to let in&mdash;was it really
Piny?&nbsp; The tall figure was attired in a bright red muslin
much beruffled.&nbsp; A brilliant bow with generous outstanding
loops surmounted the dozen or more puffs of hair, and excitement
lent additional colour to cheeks that were always flushed.</p>
<p>Nancy Jane hurried over to the Hall and up to her room.&nbsp;
She didn&rsquo;t even take time to ask Gincy why she had sent
Piny Twilliger to guard the precious cream.&nbsp; It
wouldn&rsquo;t do to say much about kinfolk.&nbsp; But all the
time she was hurrying into her white dotted lawn, she wondered if
anything would happen to their eatables.&nbsp; Surely some of the
girls would be ready in a few minutes.</p>
<p>It was almost a quarter of eight when Nancy Jane ran down the
front stairs.&nbsp; She rapped lightly at several doors, but
there was no response.&nbsp; Evidently everybody who belonged to
the Mountain Society had gone.&nbsp; It was only a short distance
to the Industrial Building, and she ran across the campus <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>toward the
lights.&nbsp; There was the buzzing of excited voices&mdash;the
front walk seemed thronged with students.&nbsp; What could have
happened?&nbsp; Nancy Jane felt an awful premonition of
disaster.&nbsp; Of course it was the cream.&nbsp; Piny must have
left her post and some of the boys carried it off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Nancy Jane?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
Mallie&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;The cake&rsquo;s
gone&mdash;every scrap!&nbsp; Some one rapped on the door and
Piny went out; it was the boys with the cream, and while they
were talking some one tore the screen and jumped in the side
window and took every smitch of cake off the table.&nbsp;
Piny&rsquo;s rushing &rsquo;round like a hornet and vows
she&rsquo;ll find out who did it before she sleeps a wink
to-night.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t believe she can; it&rsquo;s
either eaten up or hidden by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy Jane listened in dismay.&nbsp; All their lovely frosted
cake gone!&nbsp; She ran into the room looking for
Piny&mdash;somehow she wanted to hear the whole story from her
lips.</p>
<p>But among the babel of voices Piny&rsquo;s could not be
heard.&nbsp; She had disappeared completely and did not hear
Martin&rsquo;s angry comment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if she had hidden it herself; she&rsquo;d think that was a
great joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Martin,&rdquo; said Talitha, &ldquo;Piny
isn&rsquo;t mean if she is fond of a joke.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Martin&rsquo;s eyes continued to flash as he walked out into the
dark, around the building, and looked up at the outside
stairs.&nbsp; They were built more <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>as a fire-escape, but the boys on
the upper floor often used them.&nbsp; Martin stood in the shadow
of the wood-working department and eyed the row of lighted
windows.&nbsp; A dark object was crouched on the upper step and
as he eyed it intently, it rose and began a noiseless
descent.</p>
<p>Martin edged as close as he dared.&nbsp; It passed the lower
window and he saw, to his utter amazement, that it was Piny
Twilliger, who seemed in great haste to get down.&nbsp; He
intercepted her as she reached the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
it, Piny?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found them!&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;and
the cake isn&rsquo;t eaten yet.&nbsp; Get all the boys together
you can.&nbsp; Some will have to watch the door of their
room&mdash;it&rsquo;s Seth Laney and that crowd.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d better get the Shackley boys and go up on the
outside&mdash;that&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;ll get
in.&nbsp; While the rest are making an awful racket in the hall
to attract their attention, you can climb in the
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do beat everything!&rdquo; exclaimed Martin, quite
conscience-smitten to think he had ever suspected Piny.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a regular general!&nbsp; You bet we&rsquo;ll
get that cake,&rdquo; and he ran around the building and into the
big front entrance like a shot.</p>
<p>It took only a minute to plan the campaign as outlined by
Piny.&nbsp; There was an instant siege&mdash;within ten minutes
an unconditional surrender&mdash;and the cake was saved.&nbsp;
Borne <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>down in triumph by Martin and Abner, they paused in
front of her with a low bow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; they
said, &ldquo;the honour belongs to you.&nbsp; Have a
piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Piny laughingly refused to be made a heroine of, and
waited until every one else was served.&nbsp; She blushed
furiously when they toasted her in lemonade for her presence of
mind and courage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon hit wan&rsquo;t
much,&rdquo; she said, modestly disclaiming all honours.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d promised to watch things, an&rsquo; I
wan&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be beaten nohow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spread was a great success.&nbsp; Afterwards, Abner walked
back to the Hall with Gincy and Lalla.&nbsp; &ldquo;You helped me
a lot,&rdquo; he assured the latter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I worked up all
those notes you gave me and they seemed to strike the nail on the
head.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see how you ever thought of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t anything,&rdquo; said Lalla,
&ldquo;you had a dozen points a good deal better than mine.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m glad the decision was unanimous for you, though; it was
a bigger honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you helped Abner,&rdquo; remarked
Gincy as they sat in her room waiting for the warning bell to
ring.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of him and grateful to
you.&nbsp; Miss Howard says you do splendidly in your work this
term, Lalla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always say such nice things,&rdquo; answered Lalla,
evading Gincy&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t another
girl in Bentville who has <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>encouraged me the way you
have.&nbsp; I guess I remember, and&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She broke
off suddenly.&nbsp; Perhaps after all she would better tell Gincy
the truth about the debate.</p>
<p>Gincy listened, her hard-working hands tightly clasped, and a
sinking at her heart.&nbsp; It was just plain cheating and the
Gooch family had never done anything like that.&nbsp; Of course
Abner didn&rsquo;t know or he never would have used the paper
Lalla gave him&mdash;that was one comfort.&nbsp; Then Gincy
thought of Raphael.&nbsp; Perhaps after all the medal really
belonged to him; but how could she straighten it all out?&nbsp;
Why were there so many tangles in life, anyhow?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gincy,&rdquo; said Lalla, abruptly changing the
subject, &ldquo;that Mr. Gantley has come back.&nbsp; Talitha
told me this evening and I forgot to tell you.&nbsp; The college
folks found him up in that shack on the mountain, and they told
him he&rsquo;d got to go to work or they&rsquo;d lock him up, and
then they gave him a job in the garden.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t
worry about the family any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lalla ran to her room at the sound of the bell, leaving Gincy
in a brown study.&nbsp; If she told it might get Lalla and Abner
into all kinds of trouble.&nbsp; Perhaps they would even have the
debate all over again with a new subject, or Abner might have to
give up the medal in disgrace.&nbsp; There were so many terrible
possibilities, Gincy slept little that night.&nbsp; <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>Early the
next morning she arose fully decided on a course of action.&nbsp;
Miss Howard should settle it; she could hardly wait to find
her.</p>
<p>The little teacher listened patiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you this evening.&nbsp; Come to my room at half-past seven;
meanwhile don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat comforted, Gincy went about her work.&nbsp; Promptly
at seven she presented herself at Miss Howard&rsquo;s door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t wait another minute,&rdquo; she said
by way of apology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; was the
assurance.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; Professor
Ames says the decision might not have been unanimous, but Abner
would have received the medal anyhow on his main argument.&nbsp;
It isn&rsquo;t necessary that anything be said about it except to
Lalla.&nbsp; We want her to cultivate higher ideas of honour than
those she has been used to at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy left the room jubilant; a great burden had rolled off
her mind.&nbsp; She could go to bed with a clear conscience and
make up the sleep she had lost the night before.</p>

KID SHACKLEY GETS A GLIMPSE OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Shackley cabin stood high and
dry above the bed of Goose Creek; for, while there was nothing to
fear from the narrow, trickling stream of summer, the moody,
tempestuous torrent of spring threatened everything within reach,
and Enoch Shackley was a cautious man.</p>
<p>It was ten o&rsquo;clock, but the flickering of flambeaux, the
sound of hurrying feet over the bare floor of the long
living-room, the uneasy tugging of old Bob at his chain, and a
saddled mule in front of the door, indicated some unusual
nocturnal adventure.</p>
<p>Presently, far in the distance could be heard the creak of a
jolt wagon and the sound of voices singing &ldquo;Sourwood
Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cabin door suddenly flew open and Kid Shackley
appeared.&nbsp; He was a chunky, muscular boy, a worthy successor
of his father, when the blacksmith should grow too old to follow
his trade.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re comin&rsquo;, mammy!&nbsp;
Good-bye, I&rsquo;ll tell you and pappy all &rsquo;bout hit when
I git back.&nbsp; Looks like a feller kin hear ter Kingdom Come
in the night time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>His
place in the doorway was filled by a tall, gaunt figure in a
meagre dress of blue calico, who peered out anxiously after
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t ye hongry, son?&nbsp; Whar
d&rsquo;ye reckon ye&rsquo;ll git yore breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam Gooch &rsquo;lows we&rsquo;ll be at Redbird
somewhar near the Twilligers&mdash;Eli&rsquo;s kin.&nbsp; Likely
they&rsquo;ll want ter go on &rsquo;count of Piny.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll get ter the Branch &rsquo;bout sun-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kid was in the saddle now, facing the newcomers.&nbsp; The
jolt wagon with its oxen threading along the stony bed of Goose
Creek&mdash;a lantern hung in front of the driver&mdash;cast long
shadows which seemed to multiply like those of a mysterious
moving caravan.&nbsp; They filled the gorge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;G&rsquo;lang, Billy,&rdquo; and Kid was slowly
descending the steep incline to join the travellers who suddenly
halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, come on!&rdquo; chorused the voices from
below.</p>
<p>Kid greeted the half-dozen occupants of the wagon in true
mountain fashion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Howdy, Dan Gooch,&rdquo; to the
man guiding the oxen, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re here on time.&nbsp; I
heerd our rooster speakin&rsquo; up a spell back.&nbsp; He
reckoned &rsquo;twas mornin&rsquo; by the clatter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d better watch out or Brer Fox&rsquo;ll get
him.&nbsp; Them pesky varmints tuk nigh onto twenty little uns
fer us last night.&nbsp; G&rsquo;lang, Bright!&rdquo; and the
cracking whip and groaning wagon drowned the greetings of the
others.</p>
<p><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>Kid
fell in behind.&nbsp; There was no possible chance for
conversation, so they sang old English ballads, and &ldquo;The
Old Time Religion,&rdquo; which Talitha had taught them.&nbsp; As
they rode along in the damp coolness, Kid watched the lumbering
wagon ahead, full of indistinct figures, with a curious feeling
of something new and strange about to enter his life.</p>
<p>Right and left, the great pine-covered mountains both guarded
and threatened with their looming shapes.&nbsp; The highest part
of the creek bed made the only passable wagon road, and that was
poor enough.&nbsp; The air was full of moist odours, and above,
the deep blue dome was pierced with twinkling points of
light.</p>
<p>The night wore on until the twinkling lights were lost, and a
greyness settled over the mountain world.&nbsp; They were
travelling northwest, leaving range after range of the
Cumberlands, broken only by the deep gorge of a river bed, behind
them.&nbsp; Ahead, were the foothills, and beyond, Kid had never
seen.&nbsp; He only knew from the glowing accounts of Pete, and
Isaac, and Talitha&mdash;who had made him promise to come to
Bentville&mdash;that the Blue Grass in all its richness lay very
near the college.</p>
<p>Leaving the river bed they struck a mountain road which led,
at long intervals, past lonely, unpainted cabins more humble than
those in the small settlement at Goose Creek.&nbsp; Early <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>as it was,
people were astir, noisily harnessing their mules, or yoking
oxen.&nbsp; Here and there a jaded saddle-horse or spirited colt
was being pressed into service.&nbsp; They were all bound for the
same place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s like a circus, er buryin&rsquo;, er
baptizin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; and here words failed him.&nbsp;
But he remembered Talitha&rsquo;s description, and tried to
imagine how it would seem to see thousands of people on one
level, wooded space.</p>
<p>They had stopped singing now.&nbsp; A faint, rosy glow was
spreading above the mountains back of them, and glimpses of a
great rolling valley came from the front.&nbsp; The road ran
steeply down, causing the occupants of the wagon to sway in their
chairs.&nbsp; Dan Gooch plied the brake, vociferating to his
oxen: &ldquo;Hi thar, Bright!&nbsp; Steady, Star!&nbsp; See,
yon&rsquo;s Redbird!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam Coyle straightened an inert figure.&nbsp; He had been half
dozing, conscious of little except his broken rest.&nbsp; His
journey to Bentville was prompted by a curiosity which had been
growing ever since Abner had won the medal.&nbsp; There was a
little pricking below the jealousy in his heart when he thought
what a &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; father he had been.&nbsp; Dan Gooch
was growing more enthusiastic every day over
&ldquo;larnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sam wondered if it were too
late&mdash;here he glanced at his wife&rsquo;s worn but radiant
face.&nbsp; She was looking in the direction of Redbird, but he
knew that her heart was going out <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>to Martin and Talitha in Bentville,
and that she had nothing to regret.</p>
<p>Billy and Sudie grew more excited each moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m that hongry I could eat a bear; I hope
they&rsquo;ll have one fer breakfast!&rdquo; exclaimed the
former.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More like it&rsquo;ll be a chicken,&rdquo; laughed Kid
as he guided Nick nearer the wagon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw Zeb
Twilliger in the hen yard a minute ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lank, high cheek-boned mountaineer came slouching toward the
gate as they drove up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Light and hitch,&rdquo; he
commanded hospitably.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon yo&rsquo;re bound fer
Bentville.&nbsp; Piny&rsquo;s been pesterin&rsquo; the life out
o&rsquo; us ter come; she sent word agin this week, an&rsquo; I
&rsquo;low ef she&rsquo;s honin&rsquo; fer us, we&rsquo;d shore
ought ter go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I told pappy,&rdquo; interrupted Kid
eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He and mammy bide in the Hollow till
they&rsquo;re fair mossy.&nbsp; Pete and Ike&rsquo;ll come back
plumb shamed of we-uns.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the boy flushed at
what the words implied.</p>
<p>Sam Coyle failed to make his usual sarcastic retort to the
thrust at Goose Creek.&nbsp; Indeed he was quite amiable to Kid
on their way up to the door of the rather untidy looking
cabin.&nbsp; There was plenty of bacon and cornbread, with coffee
and fresh buttermilk for breakfast.&nbsp; The chickens were for
their dinner and had been cooked the day before.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never count on eatin&rsquo; chicken till I get a holt of the
drumstick,&rdquo; whispered Billy to Kid, rolling his eyes.</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>Mrs.
Twilliger was large and loud-voiced.&nbsp; The older children had
all married and left home except Piny.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
planned ter keep her fer a spell yit, but I don&rsquo;t reckon
nothin&rsquo; ever&rsquo;ll suit her &rsquo;round here now
she&rsquo;s taken ter schoolin&rsquo;; she air a queer
gal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let hit fret me,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Gooch with unexpected spirit, &ldquo;the mountings air
needin&rsquo; a few idees; I&rsquo;m glad Gincy&rsquo;s
gittin&rsquo; &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m plumb wore out with the
old ones.&nbsp; She and Tally&rsquo;d much better be
larnin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; books than marryin&rsquo; some no
&rsquo;count chap thet goes r&rsquo;arin&rsquo; &rsquo;round,
shootin&rsquo; up things ginerally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Twilliger bristled up instantly; the description fitted
her eldest son-in-law too closely for her liking.&nbsp; However,
Mrs. Gooch had an unexpected ally in the master of the
house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s my idee; Piny&rsquo;s
harum-scarum &rsquo;nough without gittin&rsquo; in with these
chaps &rsquo;round yere.&nbsp; We hev &rsquo;nough o&rsquo; them
fellers in the fambly a&rsquo;ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast over, every one hurried to get a good start for the
last part of the journey to Bentville.&nbsp; The Twilliger outfit
was a span of fat mules and a light wagon.&nbsp; They took the
lead, and the oxen were soon far behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better push on, Kid,&rdquo; advised Dan
Gooch as the oxen toiled up the last foothill before reaching the
valley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yon&rsquo;s Bentville&mdash;almost in
sight.&nbsp; Zeb Twilliger will be thar an hour ahead of
us.&nbsp; Nick hez sperit &rsquo;nough <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>ter ketch
up ter &rsquo;em stid of pokin&rsquo; &rsquo;long so powerful
slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kid took the advice.&nbsp; As he reached the top of the hill,
he reined Nick in for a moment to look at the panorama of colour
which spread below him.&nbsp; There were fields of corn and hemp
threaded with a narrow, silver path of water.&nbsp; Beyond the
valley, on a little plateau, was the white tower of a
chapel.&nbsp; The trees were thick, but they could not entirely
screen the angular outlines of the college buildings occupying
the highest part of the little town.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s heart beat fast.&nbsp; He had never been more
than ten miles away from home in all his life before.&nbsp;
Somehow the blacksmith&rsquo;s trade did not seem so alluring as
it had yesterday; perhaps Pete and Isaac were right after
all.&nbsp; He was proud of them anyhow.</p>
<p>Down, down toward the bridge which crossed Brushy Fork and the
Big Hill Pike with the hard part of the journey behind him, Kid
overtook the Twilligers.&nbsp; He exchanged a few remarks, then
cantered past, and joined the long procession of vehicles and
horsemen, all headed in the same direction.&nbsp; This beat a
circus, it beat Talitha&rsquo;s description carefully recalled
from last year.</p>
<p>Kid was beginning to get excited.&nbsp; He passed team after
team with a cheery hail, and forged straight up the hill.&nbsp;
Nick did not need to be urged; he galloped directly into the
crowd, and then past, only slowing down on the main <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>street for
Kid to gaze with fascinated eyes at the booths of popcorn, candy,
peanuts, and ice cream.&nbsp; Everywhere were students spreading
their wares in tempting proximity to the passersby.&nbsp; On all
sides signs read: &ldquo;This Way to the Campus.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Visit the Chapel Tower.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;See the
Industrial Building.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Miss the
Homespun Fair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kid looked at everything with eager eyes.&nbsp; How could he
ever see it all in a day!&nbsp; So far there were no familiar
faces.&nbsp; Nick plodded along in the jam of teams quite
subdued.&nbsp; There were lean, spiritless nags drawing
&ldquo;sorry&rdquo; buggies, jolt wagons and oxen, mules and more
mules.&nbsp; Kid watched them all&mdash;the black sunbonnets, the
over-trimmed hats, the attractive young faces and those lacking
purpose.&nbsp; Where were Martin, and Abner, and the rest?&nbsp;
He looked up at the big boarding hall set back in a yard full of
trees.&nbsp; A throng was pouring out of the side entrance.&nbsp;
They were singing a rollicking class song which appealed to
Kid&rsquo;s music-loving heart.&nbsp; As they came toward him he
saw Martin and Isaac leading the crowd.</p>
<p>Almost at the same instant they discovered him and made a rush
forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hello, Kid, you&rsquo;re just in time;
we&rsquo;re going over to the Tabernacle this minute!&rdquo;
exclaimed Isaac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t any one else come?&rdquo; asked
Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see later,&rdquo; Kid assured him with a
grin, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;ll I do with Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>They
led him into a long, roped driveway which crossed a little rustic
bridge.&nbsp; There, in the wooded part of the campus, were
hundreds of teams hitched to the trees or eating from the backs
of wagons.&nbsp; In a bag thrown across the saddle, Kid had
brought feed for the mule.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a good
place, it&rsquo;s near the road and shady, too,&rdquo; said
Isaac.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come back after a while and find
the rest of the folks.&nbsp; Now let&rsquo;s hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three boys started toward a huge, unpainted building with
a large sign across the front, &ldquo;The Tabernacle,&rdquo; it
read.&nbsp; People were standing near the two large entrances
which were closed.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go around; I know the
way,&rdquo; said Martin.&nbsp; There were several doors securely
locked, but one was ajar.&nbsp; The three slipped in.&nbsp; The
room was full of piney odours from the banked-up platform.&nbsp;
High up behind the seats for the graduates a dozen or more boys
and girls were fastening festoons of flowers above a solid wall
of green.&nbsp; Kid had never seen anything of the kind
before.&nbsp; He stared at the sawdust on the floor which muffled
their footsteps, at the semi-circle of raised seats which were
soon to be filled with mountain people, then back again to the
hurrying boys and girls in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there isn&rsquo;t Kid Shockley!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
Abner&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello!&rdquo; called Pete, turning suddenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where are the rest of the folks?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>&ldquo;Come up here, Kid,&rdquo; called out
Talitha.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Gincy and Mallie and all of
the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment Kid felt as though he had been in Bentville a
week.&nbsp; He was hailed cordially by all of the Goose Creek
people and immediately set to work breaking branches for
trimming, and hanging banners under the direction of Lalla.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to be awfully quiet,&rdquo; she
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a half-hour before the
doors are opened and two of the graduates have to rehearse
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his vantage ground above, Kid looked down at the critics
on the front seat and the tall, dark young man who had begun to
speak.&nbsp; What a contrast the clear, ringing tones were to
those of the mountain orators he had heard.&nbsp; For a moment he
almost forgot to help Lalla and stood, his arms full of pine
branches, listening intently to the oration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, Kid,&rdquo; reminded Lalla.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to drag this litter out and just rush over
to the chapel to see them form in line; there isn&rsquo;t a
minute to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The musical peal of a bell and the rat-tat-tat of a drum
decided the matter.&nbsp; In less than five minutes the two were
crossing the campus in the rear of a number of stragglers who
were hurrying to see the long procession begin its march.</p>
<h2><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>XVIII<br />
COMMENCEMENT TIME AT BENTVILLE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Talitha</span>, from her room in the hall,
saw the oxen toiling up the hill just as the chapel bell was
ringing.&nbsp; She had rushed over from the Tabernacle to dress
and get back before the lines were formed.&nbsp; In fifteen
minutes the bell would begin to toll and the procession
start.&nbsp; Her father and mother must not miss it.&nbsp; She
opened the door and sped down the corridor to Gincy&rsquo;s
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she called out, pounding on the door
insistently, &ldquo;the folks are almost here.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
one of you go down and bring them up to my room&mdash;your mother
and my mother, Gincy?&nbsp; The rest can go on; you can tell them
where to hitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy needed no second bidding; she fairly flew downstairs and
out of doors.&nbsp; At the side gate she stood for a moment and
peered into the faces of the crowd.&nbsp; Presently she spied the
objects of her search.&nbsp; The big red ox and the one with the
white star on his forehead were coming her way.&nbsp; Sudie and
Billy waved their hands, her father smiled, and <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>Sam
Coyle&rsquo;s indolent figure seemed to grow in stature.&nbsp;
Only the two sunbonneted women on the back seat appeared quiet
and indifferent, but Gincy knew that inwardly they were far from
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talitha saw you from her room,&rdquo; she said after
the first greeting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jump right out and we&rsquo;ll
go up there; she&rsquo;s rushing to get ready for the exercises
and there are only a few minutes left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gincy hurried them through the crowd and into the dormitory
hall, which was alive with girls greeting friends and showing
them around through the various rooms.&nbsp; Her mother and Mrs.
Coyle were allowed one peep into the office of the dean, and the
big east parlour with its Colonial furniture and handsome
pictures&mdash;gifts from wealthy New England people&mdash;then
they were whisked upstairs and into Number 45 to receive a warm
greeting from Talitha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like it?&rdquo; she asked, seating them near
the open windows.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can look all around while
Gincy&rsquo;s hooking my dress.&rdquo;&nbsp; Below, were the
long, well-watered rows of the college garden&mdash;a wonderful
sight to eyes accustomed to the small, dried-up mountain patch of
vegetables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a sightly place,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Gooch,
her face alive with interest.</p>
<p>Mrs. Coyle nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;And fraish air kin pass
through ter let out all the odours,&rdquo; her <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>mind
evidently intent on the airy location of the room.&nbsp; Then she
glanced at the white tucked dress lying on the lower berth of the
double-decker.</p>
<p>Her daughter followed the gaze.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at
Gincy&rsquo;s; hers has more tucks.&rdquo;&nbsp; Talitha slipped
the princess gown over her head, all the while smiling
delightedly at the amazement in the faces of her guests.</p>
<p>They plied her with questions.&nbsp; How did she get in all
those little pleats?&nbsp; Who helped her cut and fit it?&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t they visit the sewing-room?&nbsp; To which Talitha
responded as eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, I&rsquo;m almost ready;
we&rsquo;ll go on the first stroke of the last bell.&nbsp; After
the exercises we&rsquo;ll have dinner, and then I&rsquo;m bound
to show you everything on the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out of this window,&rdquo; said Gincy, pointing to
a stretch of trailing plants on the south side of the
house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Strawberries!&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t they
splendid?&nbsp; Father&rsquo;s got to have some just like
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abner and Martin have learned a lot about horticulture;
they&rsquo;ll tend to things,&rdquo; said Talitha, noticing the
look on her mother&rsquo;s face which seemed to say as plainly as
words: &ldquo;Your father wouldn&rsquo;t find time for anything
of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first stroke of the last bell, the four descended the
stairs and followed the crowd going in the direction of the
Tabernacle.&nbsp; The college band in bright, new uniforms, was
<a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>playing
a lively air near the chapel door.&nbsp; From every direction the
people streamed toward it.&nbsp; A long line of the faculty and
college graduates was being rapidly formed; each of the latter
wearing a band of purple and gold around the left arm.&nbsp; For
the most part they were simply dressed, but in their bearing one
could detect a vast difference from the raw material that had
flocked in to Commencement.</p>
<p>The little group from back in the hills was only one of many
who looked with proud, expectant eyes toward the future.&nbsp; It
would be a great day when one of their number stood in that long
line waiting for the honours which were to crown faithful
endeavour.&nbsp; Talitha was glad to discover her father looking
with pleased interest at the young faces so full of
promise.&nbsp; Her one desire had been to make him see the
difference between those who had had advantages, and the boys and
girls, who, without education, were living dull, cramped lives in
the mountains.</p>
<p>Suddenly the lively air changed, and a hundred young voices
took up the refrain: &ldquo;We march, we march, to
victory&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Coyle&rsquo;s eyes filled as the ranks went sweeping
by.&nbsp; She could hardly see to follow them, but
Talitha&rsquo;s strong arm supported her, and, heading the folks
from Goose Creek, they filed into the Tabernacle and sat down
with the great crowd who had already assembled.</p>
<p>A great hush followed the prayer.&nbsp; Gincy <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>watched her
father and mother keenly as the Hallelujah Chorus pealed forth;
then she gave Talitha one quick, triumphant glance.&nbsp; Their
faces were full of wonder and pleasure, and Sam Coyle&rsquo;s
stolid countenance wore a look of startled interest, the like of
which she had never seen before.</p>
<p>One by one the graduates took their places for the brief time
allotted them.&nbsp; They spoke in loud, clear voices, but Sam
Coyle seemed hardly to understand, until a dark-haired girl began
about &ldquo;The Land of Appalachia.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gave the
history of the mountain people, how, shut back in the hills, they
were behind the rest of the world.&nbsp; What wonderful resources
were right at hand if they would only wake up and use them.&nbsp;
How education meant changing the home life and giving more to the
girls and boys which would end in a better life for the
parents.</p>
<p>The hungry look on Mrs. Coyle&rsquo;s face fairly devoured the
speaker.&nbsp; Already she was reaping her reward, and visions of
Goose Creek, alive to its sore need of an education, blotted out
the great audience around her.&nbsp; She sat almost motionless
throughout the exercises.&nbsp; Children cried, people came and
went, the band played &ldquo;Dixie&rdquo;; it was greeted
noisily.&nbsp; It played again.&nbsp; This time it was
&ldquo;America,&rdquo; and a flutter of white handkerchiefs came
from where the teachers sat; then they arose, and somehow in a
minute the crowd from Goose <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>Creek found themselves standing,
too.&nbsp; Mrs. Coyle&rsquo;s eyes were moist, and Dan Gooch
swallowed a troublesome lump in his throat.&nbsp; Billy and Sudie
looked awed and timid, yet they quivered with delight, and Gincy,
her arms resting lightly upon their shoulders, felt the quiver
and held them closer.</p>
<p>The crowd poured out and melted into groups which gathered
around well-filled baskets, or ate sandwiches, and bananas, and
drank lemonade at the big stand near the library.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
we could only invite you over to the Hall,&rdquo; said Gincy
regretfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;We tried to get you in, but Miss Denman
says she can hardly find room for the company at the two new
tables.&nbsp; Commencement is a great day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we can do what most of the strangers air
doin&rsquo;&mdash;eat our own vittles; they&rsquo;ll be plumb
spoiled if we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dan Gooch with mock
severity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on, chil&rsquo;ren,&rdquo; to Billy
and Sudie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit beats anythin&rsquo; I ever saw!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sam Coyle, ignoring his neighbour&rsquo;s last remark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hone ter come&mdash;at fust&mdash;that crap
in the south cove needs a powerful lot o&rsquo; tendin&rsquo;,
but I &rsquo;lowed &rsquo;twould be a pritty day, an&rsquo;
Tally&rsquo;d feel mightily disapinted if I
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I would, father,&rdquo; said Talitha, her
eyes fixed on her mother&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
not be sorry you came, either, there&rsquo;s so much <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>to see
after dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she started off arm in arm with
Gincy, too happy over her mother&rsquo;s evident pleasure and her
father&rsquo;s sudden interest to think of that old
excuse&mdash;the neglected &ldquo;crap&rdquo; in the south
cove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; called Talitha as Kid Shackley came
within hailing distance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Having a good
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; was the emphatic response.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve cut loose and am doin&rsquo; hit by
myself.&nbsp; Seen the folks?&nbsp; They have the stuff to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha pointed back to the throng under the oak trees.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve just gone.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll catch them
before they get fairly started eating if you hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tally,&rdquo; said Gincy as Kid dodged from view
behind the crowd of vehicles, his boyish head held high,
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t Commencement just grand!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so
happy over everything&mdash;Abner&rsquo;s new suit, and the folks
coming, and&mdash;honey, your daddy thinks Bentville is all
right; he&rsquo;ll never say another word against it, I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talitha nodded.&nbsp; Her face was radiant and she squeezed
Gincy&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s Kid, he acts
so different; just wild over everything here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure he&rsquo;ll be in school next year, too.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
the five-minute bell now; we&rsquo;ll have to eat fast and get
back.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just crazy to see father&rsquo;s face when
he gets into the Industrial Building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mother&rsquo;s when she sees the Homespun <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>Fair;
she&rsquo;ll go wild over the rugs, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back under the trees groups of people were refreshing
themselves.&nbsp; The sun flecked the broad backs of the oxen
feeding from the rear end of the jolt wagons.&nbsp; The mules
were sleepily warding off the flies.&nbsp; A few horses stamped
restlessly.&nbsp; And on each side of the driveway was a mass of
life and colour enveloped in the fragrant air of June.&nbsp;
Under its dominating spell, the Goose Creek folks sat until the
mass of humanity began to move; only the babies slept, guarded by
their mothers.</p>
<p>As though suddenly roused to action, the young people began to
walk back and forth through the wooded space, some aimlessly,
others with a definite objective point in view.&nbsp; From the
chapel tower, the group from Goose Creek could hear a voice
inviting everybody to come up and see the surrounding
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Martin,&rdquo; said Kid.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got what he names a megaphone.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
call hit a horn-a whopper.&nbsp; You kin hear hit a mile,
I&rsquo;ll bet; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; up after a spell ter
he&rsquo;p him out&mdash;thar come the gals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just pouring into the Homespun
Fair,&rdquo; said Gincy, coming up breathless.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve almost run so you wouldn&rsquo;t get crowded
out entirely.&nbsp; Sudie and Billy&rsquo;d better come with me
and get some lemonade at the stand; Talitha&rsquo;s waiting over
there for the rest of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like ter see some kiverlids thet can
beat mammy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Dan Gooch as they walked briskly
along in the direction indicated by Gincy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reckon as how you will,&rdquo; responded
his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was hard ter beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned into the arched entrance of a big, brick building
and elbowed through the crowd toward a large room indicated by
the guides.&nbsp; Once inside, Mrs. Coyle drew a quick breath of
pleased astonishment.&nbsp; Long tables down the centre of the
room were covered with linen squares of familiar patterns.&nbsp;
There were also rugs and draperies, and innumerable articles of
unique home workmanship.&nbsp; The walls were hung with
&ldquo;kiverlids&rdquo; and quilts of brilliant patterns.&nbsp;
The Rising Sun, Indian Feather, Fruit Basket, and many others
showed to the best advantage in the well-lighted place.</p>
<p>Sam Coyle found his way to a table covered with splint
baskets.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, beckoning to
Talitha and pointing to the price-mark on a medium sized
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seventy-five cents is a heap of money fer thet;
I reckon they won&rsquo;t sell nary a one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sam Coyle reckoned in vain, for Talitha showed him the
little tag marked &ldquo;Sold&rdquo; tied to the opposite side of
the handle; her eyes sparkling at his look of amazement.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I used ter make toler&rsquo;ble fair ones myself, years
back,&rdquo; he said, examining it carefully.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gooch dropped into a splint-bottomed <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>rocker in
front of a gorgeous red and green quilt.&nbsp; She was studying
the price-mark and the pattern.&nbsp; Ten dollars seemed an
immense amount of money to pay for it.&nbsp; She beckoned to Mrs.
Coyle, who was fingering the linen.&nbsp; &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye
think o&rsquo; thet?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Her neighbour stepped back slowly, viewing the quilt from all
points of vantage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yourn is a heap purtier, but this
hez more fine stitches,&rdquo; she remarked at last
judicially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe hit hez, but hit tuk more fine pieces fer ourn,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d be proud ter git half as much.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Gooch was thinking of Sudie and Billy, who would soon be
ready for Bentville.&nbsp; Here was an unexpected source of
revenue.</p>
<p>One by one Mrs. Coyle examined the squares of linen with a
triumphant feeling.&nbsp; All day her heart had been sinking at
the thought of her ignorance.&nbsp; She had been bewildered and
overwhelmed by this new world of opportunity and knowledge.&nbsp;
Now she experienced a quick return of self-respect as she heard
well-dressed visitors exclaim in admiration, and saw the ready
sale of the linen.&nbsp; She not only knew the patterns, but had
worked out some original designs of her own.&nbsp; Here was
surely a way to earn more money.</p>
<p>It was fully twenty minutes later when Gincy came panting in
without Sudie and Billy.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found Pete
and Isaac,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;re going
to the top of <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>the tower.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll meet us somewhere near
the Industrial Building.&nbsp; Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only a short distance, but every step was blocked by
groups of visitors, lemonade stands, amateur photographers,
venders of patent medicines.&nbsp; A wrinkled, toothless old
woman sat close to the path smoking her pipe.&nbsp; She wore a
black calico dress and sunbonnet, and black wool mitts.&nbsp;
Gincy drew a long breath and thought, for the first time in her
life, what it meant to grow old like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an awful crowd, but
we&rsquo;ll manage to see things somehow.&rdquo;&nbsp; People
were pushing their way into the long building and filling the
rooms on either side of the hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s show
them the cooking first,&rdquo; said Talitha as Gincy started for
the sewing department.</p>
<p>Mrs. Coyle edged her way to the glass cases in the centre of
the room.&nbsp; They were filled with all kinds of
eatables&mdash;salads, delicious looking rolls, pies, puddings,
and chicken done to a turn.&nbsp; It took some time to convince
her that everything was cooked in those queer-looking
boxes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fireless cookers!&rdquo; she exclaimed
incredulously.&nbsp; &ldquo;It do beat everythin&rsquo;, Tally,
how they do things here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can make one for you, mother, if Martin can&rsquo;t
find time; it may not look just like the ones here, but it will
work splendidly, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>&ldquo;Shore?&rdquo; asked her mother doubtfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be proud ter hev one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men folks seemed equally interested.&nbsp; They gazed at
the canned fruit in the open cupboards, at the model table set
for four, and were quite unwilling to leave when the boys came to
take them to the Sloyd room.</p>
<p>The hall upstairs was crowded, there were so many things to
see in the different rooms.&nbsp; Mrs. Gooch kept an eye out for
Billy and Sudie, who had not put in an appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be in the Sloyd room, I know,&rdquo;
Talitha assured her.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Shackley boys fairly live
there; Abner and Martin wouldn&rsquo;t be much better if they
weren&rsquo;t taking extra studies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd in the room was beginning to thin a little.&nbsp; A
few were still buying bookracks, paper knives, and other small
things which were for sale.</p>
<p>Sam Coyle could hardly believe that the students had made
everything on exhibition.&nbsp; He halted in front of a big,
leather-covered chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look here, you-all,&rdquo; he
said, sinking down with characteristic indolence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hit sets powerful easy, too.&nbsp; Thet&rsquo;s what
I&rsquo;d hone ter do if I war young; we wouldn&rsquo;t live like
we do now, but thet&rsquo;s plumb past mendin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t, father, if you&rsquo;ll let Martin
help you,&rdquo; Talitha answered decidedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
always knew you were handy with tools, and we&rsquo;re going to
have some&mdash;there&rsquo;s Sudie now, <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>Mrs. Gooch;
they&rsquo;re all over behind that stack of things in the
corner.&nbsp; Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, mammy!&rdquo; announced Billy as he pointed to a
small oak table, polished to an astonishing perfection.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Abner did hit, and here&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo;
else,&rdquo; dragging her farther along toward a wide, hanging
shelf.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s fer books, and I&rsquo;m ter have
one eend.&rdquo;&nbsp; He fairly danced with happiness, and Mrs.
Gooch turned to her husband and son a face full of pride.&nbsp;
Not one sacrifice which she had made for her children seemed
worth remembering now.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Coyle&rsquo;s turn for self-gratification when
Martin showed her his book-case and seat which were to be carried
home in the jolt wagon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve some books to put
into it, too.&nbsp; Professor Johns is going to let me take
charge of the travelling library in a week or two, then
we&rsquo;ll have some good times at Goose Creek.&nbsp; Nights,
after supper is over, we&rsquo;ll take turns reading.&nbsp; Tally
and I have it all planned out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Shackley boys were not to be outdone by Martin and
Abner.&nbsp; They showed their planting pins, clock case, and
umbrella rack with much pride.&nbsp; Kid examined everything
carefully for the fourth or fifth time.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
comin&rsquo; ter Bentville next year,&rdquo; he announced
decidedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; ter work in the
wood-working department; they want more boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan Gooch patted the broad back.&nbsp; &ldquo;See <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>you do,
son.&nbsp; Your pappy kin git plenty of husky fellers fer
blacksmithin&rsquo; &rsquo;thout usin&rsquo; brains, and
you&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kid blushed and eyed Sam
Coyle furtively, waiting for the accustomed gibes, but they did
not come.&nbsp; The latter individual was apparently engrossed in
a mental estimation of the height of the huge standpipe in plain
sight of the back windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thar ain&rsquo;t the Twilligers!&rdquo; he said,
looking around suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d an idee
they&rsquo;d drapped off&rsquo;n the fur aidge of the yarth
&rsquo;fore this, and had a notion ter begin sarchin&rsquo; fer
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piny, radiant in a new pink lawn, with her father and mother
in tow, bore directly down upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
reckoned the boys had tolled you over this way for the
wind-up.&nbsp; Look here, pappy, what do you think of this, and
this?&rdquo; pointing to the various pieces of furniture.</p>
<p>Zeb Twilliger stared open-mouthed to the unconcealed delight
of the young folks.&nbsp; It took some time to convince him and
his wife that the boys had really done the work.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wal, wal, I swan!&rdquo; he ejaculated at last, peering
down at each article critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d better give &rsquo;em a lift gittin&rsquo;
hit home,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Twilliger generously, and Zeb
agreed.</p>
<p>A white cloud of dust hovered over the long <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>procession
which filed homeward, back to the hills.&nbsp; Talitha waved
good-bye as, one by one, the college buildings were lost to
sight, and Kid&mdash;with Abner behind him in the
saddle&mdash;voiced the general sentiment of the crowd when he
turned to shout cheerily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah fer Bentville and the Goose Creek folks
who&rsquo;ll be thar next year!&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
